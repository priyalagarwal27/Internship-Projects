"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,Chethan Chandra will be seen in a travel-based musical next,"After he was last seen on the silver screen in the film Jaathre, actor Chethan Chandra had forayed into television with the daily soap Satyan Shivam Sundaram, which aired for a couple of years. This move, he says was to help him fine tune his acting prowess. But in the time since that show wound up, Chetan has been looking at cinema with a renewed vigour. The actor, who recently finished a film called Shardoola, has signed up for another to be directed by debutant filmmaker Agni.

“It is a travel-based musical love story, which I believe will be refreshing to watch. I have to change my look to play Akash, a music lover, in the film. Although it’s only a journey from Bengaluru to Madikeri, we are looking at showcasing some hitherto unexplored locations in that region. Also, the treatment of the love story is rather novel, which is why I decided to take up this film. The team recently conducted a script puja and we should be able to go on floors soon,” says Chetan.


So, has he bid adieu to television? “Yes. The brief stint in TV was intentional. After doing 10 films, a daily soap was quite a different experience, which got me a whole new fan base. But now, I want to focus only on films,” says Chetan."
"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,I am not an actress who is insecure about my screen time: Shriya,"Shriya Pilgaonkar loves animals. And her most favourite one happens to be the elephant. When she was shooting for Gurinder Chadha’s British series Beecham House, one of her co-actors, Lesley Nicols, who knew of her love for the pachyderm, got her a poster of the majestic beast from an elephant orphanage. That elephant’s name was also the same as the character she played in that series. She put up that poster on her bedroom wall. It was the first thing she’d see when she opened her eyes in the morning!
So, when an opportunity to act in Kaadan, a film that revolves around elephants, came her way, Shriya could hardly dismiss that as coincidence. “I took it as a sign that this was meant to happen,” begins the actress, who played one of the female leads in Shah Rukh Khan’s Fan.

It also helped that the subject resonated with her. “It is very relevant today when we are talking about sustainability and living in balance with nature. I felt it was very beautiful to tell a story that’s inspired by a man who is known as the Forest Man of India, one who stood up for the land that belonged to the elephants and wanted to stop it from being encroached. And knowing that Rana was part of it, I was very keen to act in it,” she explains.
She was also quite drawn to the fact that this was going to be trilingual, to be made in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu. “I’ve always wanted to explore different film industries.” My first film was a Marathi film; then, I did films in French and Hindi. Our country has so many cultures and is so diverse that the stories coming out of its different film industries are also diverse. Growing up, I’ve watched a lot of films made down south. The first few films that I saw were Mani Ratnam sir’s and Kamal Haasan sir’s films. Whether it is Mahanati or Super Deluxe, these films have travelled the world, so many people are exposed to south films now,” she states.

She says she didn’t find the prospect of acting in two languages that she doesn’t speak daunting. “I knew it would be challenging and I had no idea how I’d be approaching it, too, but I trusted the team and the director to guide me,” says Shriya. That director was Prabu Solomon, who did Kumki, so, Shriya knew she’d be in the right hands.

Interestingly, while she is making her debut in languages unfamiliar to her, the director is making his debut in Hindi. But Shriya feels that never came in the way of work. “I don’t think Prabu sir is the kind of person who thinks about all these things. He is so focussed, a really passionate person, who genuinely believes in the heart of the film. He is trying to communicate an important message, and he never thought about anything else other than trying to be true to his story. I don’t think he ever thought, ‘This is my first Hindi film. How am I going to handle it?’ To him, he was just making a film,” she says.

She remarks that the director was “very particular and very authentic” in the way he approached scenes. “For him, there are no shortcuts. So, we would actually shoot every scene thrice — first in Tamil, then in Telugu, and then in Hindi. And with all three languages, Prabu sir had a different way of guiding and directing the actors, especially Rana,” she states and elaborates, “The storytelling style in these languages is different, right? Prabu sir has a good understanding of that, which is why with certain scenes, he would tell us in what direction we had to take that scene — whether to up it or keep it subtle, how much to emote and how much not to emote. Even though the language of cinema is universal, I found it fascinating to observe how different cultures have a different approach to the same character.”

And for her, the challenge was that the actors would get most of the dialogues on the day they were shooting as the director likes to improvise a lot. Talking about her process when it came to reading her lines in Tamil and Telugu, Shriya says, “We had a writer each from Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi during the shoot. I would sit with them and try and understand the meaning of the words. But I also didn’t want the process involved in learning the language come in the way of learning the emotions. For me, it was very important to understand what I was saying so that I’d be able to emote properly. Since it was my first time, it was not easy, but now, I know I have the confidence to do it.” She informs that she actually spoke the dialogues — and not gibberish — while shooting the scenes even though she has not dubbed for herself.

Shriya plays a journalist, who “supports Rana’s journey”, in the film, “someone who does not want to succumb to pressure, and wants to stand by justice and fights for the truth — even if it is not easy to do that”. Shriya calls shooting for the film a unique experience. “We shot some of my portions in Kerala, in a forest that was far away from the city. There was no network, so the cast would sit and chat together instead of being on our phones. The environment was so perfect, especially given the film we were making. There is no typical hero-heroine in the film; in fact, you could say that the elephants are the heroes,” she states.

Wrapping up, Shriya says she is not bothered about the fact that she wouldn’t be seen throughout the film. “I am not an actress who is insecure about my screen time. I feel you should be able to create an impact, be it in five minutes or three hours. For me, it is important to be part of stories that are engaging, where my character is not a wallflower. In that sense, I feel like I’ve got the right roles so far, and I’ve just started out. Whether it is Beecham House, Fan or the action series that I recently did, I want to explore my versatility and the only way I can do that is by not being rigid about screen time,” she signs off.

Rana is an absolute team player: Shriya


Shriya is all praise for Rana and states that the actor has done a fantastic job. “Coming from Bahubali, which was a success in India and abroad, the way he had physically transformed himself to play a part like this was something so inspiring to me as an actor,” she says and adds, “Rana is an absolute team player who likes to collaborate with his co-stars. What I love about him is that he is not just an actor. He also produces and

runs other companies. He is genuinely

interested in the art of storytelling. He is

absolutely invested in the character that he plays.”

"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Diganth and Aindrita Ray’s new film to kickstart this month,"It was in the beginning of this year when Bangalore Times was the first to tell you that actors and real-life couple Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray would be reuniting on screen after eight years for a film. This film, titled Kshamisi Nimma Khaateyalli Hanavilla, is being directed by debutant filmmaker Vinayak Kodasara and also stars television actress Ranjani Raghavan. The new team is scheduled to begin shoot in Sagara from November 18.
“We are going to Sagara with a skeletal team of just 25 to 30 members and will be shooting with bare minimum people on the set. We are going to have the rest of actors coming in just for the days they have work. We have taken the necessary permissions and will be shooting with all the precautions and protocols in place,"" says Vinayak.
Incidentally, both Diganth and Vinayak hail from the same region and are excited to bring in the local nativity on screen. ""Diganth plays an areca nut farmer in the film. This is a simple story that deals with the lives of people there and is an out-and-out comedy. Most of this film is going to be shot in the Malnad regions. Only Aindrita's character is the one that is not from there, she hails from Bengaluru. So,we have a few scenes with her in Bengaluru that will be shot too,"" adds Vinayak.
While Prajwal Pai fills in as composer, Nandakishore Neelakanta Rao of Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu fame will be the cinematographer. The team will also include an ensemble cast featuring prominent comic actors."
"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,Kiran Raj teams up with Milana Nagaraj for a film helmed by Ashwin G Rao,"Kiran Raj, it would seem is on quite a signing spree. The actor, who is still seen in the serial Kannadathi, has been working on his Telugu film debut, along with a few new Kannada projects. “I recently began working on Chathushpatha, directed by Ashwin G Rao, in which I am paired with Milana Nagaraj and Shilpa. In the film, I play a normal middle-class career-oriented guy who lives by a set of values and leads a respectable life. His life changes when he meets the two girls in the tale,” says the actor, who has already shot a song from the film at Nandi Hills.

The actor has also signed two new movies, Bahaddur Gandu and Buddies. “ Buddies is about friendship, which promises to be a lot of fun, but also looks at how we should not take relationships for granted. Even when you supposedly have many friends, in your time of need, you may be all alone. This is a message that the film conveys. Bahaddur Gandu, meanwhile, will be the first out-and-out action film in my career. Though we have used the title of a famous Dr Rajkumar film, there is no other similarity between the movies. But, yes, my character will be similar to Panju from Bahaddur Gandu – someone who cannot tolerate injustice. Considering that it is an action flick, I have been working out to get a more toned, chiseled look. I am also looking at signing a comedy, tentatively titled Chicken Puliyogare, which is a cute love between a non-veg loving guy and a hardcore vegetarian girl,"" he explains.


As for his Telugu debut Vikram Goud in which he plays a cop, Kiran says that it will get a Kannada release."
"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Khushbu says she would love to act with Ravichandran again,"Actress Khushbu was in Bengaluru over the last week to campaign for the elections. While here, she also shared her fondness for the Kannada film industry, V Ravichandran in particular. The actress, who had debuted on the Kannada screen with the memorable superhit Ranadheera, says, ""I never thought I would receive so much of love for my very first film in Kannada. I was part of the Kannada film industry much before I began working in the Tamil film industry. My memories of Bengaluru will always be that of a beautiful Garden City. I still recalling going to MG Road for ice cream. Apart from that, one of my most long-lasting treasures from here is being friends with Ravichandran sir and his family, even after so many years.” Would that open doors for another possible onscreen outing starring the duo? “Someone has to come up with a really interesting subject which will suit Ravi sir and me right now. I would love to do something with him. But, of course, people remember us as such a wonderful pair that for us to do another film it has to leave a lasting impact and it should not be something that would disappoint those expectations. We will wait till we get something extraordinary to do,"" she explains, adding, ""I did make an appearance on television with him when we were celebrating 30 years of Ranadheera. It was amazing that people still loved and respected what we did three decades ago. It makes it very special."""

"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,Celebrating Tamil cinema’s golden era one reel at a time,"With uncertainty looming large over the big-screen experience, an interesting culture has come to the fore — a culture of re-watching and rediscovering cult cinema clas sics on the internet. Breaking down and celebrating such cinematic gems through quizzes, crossover trivia and videos is the popular film collective, Retro Ticket.

A product of the lockdown, the social media collective is the brainchild of seven friends from different parts of the country — Sriram Raja, Kaushik Ranganathan, Ashwath Ram, Harish Jayesh, Girish Kalyanaraman, Hariharan Balasubramanian and Karthik Ranganathan. A few months into the initial lockdown in July, the group realised that there was a lack of content that analysed vintage films, or what they call “Tamil cinema’s golden era”.


“While OTT platforms have caused a surge in the number of old movies being available online, there was a lack of content that analysed these old movies, at least in a video format,” says Karthik. Classics from the 60s, 70s and 80s like Karakattakaran, Pesum Padam, Agni Natchathiram and Pushpak have gotten hawk-eyed breakdowns from the team. The idea of the collective is to become a reliable destination for people to revisit Tamil classics, adds Sriram. “We should be able to add a unique perspective to every movie we pick and have fun while making the video so that people go back and watch the movie again,” he adds.



Analytical videos apart, Retro Ticket also keeps fans engaged with cinema trivia and crossover posts. “Right from the beginning of the lockdown, we started organising regular quizzes among friends and families, which were a big hit. So, we decided to do them on Instagram, where it would reach out to a much larger audience,” explains Ashwath.

The response from film lovers has been overwhelming, to say the least, the team exclaims. “One person even said our work made them relive the time when they watched the movie in the theatre with their now-departed loved one.

Honestly, it can’t get better than this,” Kaushik recalls. Retro-movie-watching has increased due to the unavailability of new content, the team observes, adding, “As the retro era did not have the kind of wall-to-wall exposure that is available today, people don’t realise some of the great content that came out back then.”


Stylised contemporary versions of retro content are always a hit across age-groups, the collective points out. “For instance, Petta’s references to Rajini’s movies from an earlier period resonated very well with the audience, while Venkat Prabhu movies have been very successful in using iconic Ilaiyaraaja music theme pieces to heighten the impact of the content on the screen,” Harish notes, adding, “Aged wine in a new bottle is always cool and when social media provides so many interesting ways to engage with this content, retro content is pop-culture gold-dust!”"
"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,These easy food substitutes can help you turn vegan with ease,"The biggest challenge one faces in their journey to turn vegan is about figuring out what kind of food can be consumed when one has stopped consuming some kinds of food. Often, the hinderance to make this lifestyle choice is the thought that there would be fewer food options or substitutes for regular items that offer the required nutrition that your body needs. On the contrary, nutritionists and health coaches tell us that the choices of food available in the local markets for vegans are plenty. Here are few suggestions on food substitutes that could help you make that transition with ease.


Replace meat with tofu, soya chunks and jackfruits
One of the easy substitutes for former non-vegetarians who are now vegan beginners are mock meat made up of tofu, soya chunks and jackfruit. Tofu, which is a good source of 'complete' protein along with fibre, potassium, magnesium, iron, copper and manganese, makes it a great substitute for meat. Soya chunks are also full of polyunsaturated fats and rich in protein and omega 3 fatty acids. Jackfruit is also a source of good fibre and makes for a good substitute for meat.
Replace mayonnaise with hummus or tahini
Mayonnaise, which is a mix of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice. This can be replaced with hummus, which is mashed chickpeas with herb seasonings, or Tahini, which is a paste of sesame seeds.

Replace honey with jaggery
Honey can be replaced with jaggery or stevia, especially for the ones who are more health conscious.

Replace flour with millets
Millet is a whole grain that’s packed with protein, antioxidants, and nutrients and makes for a great substitute for plain flour.

Replace eggs with Amaranth grain (Rajgira meal)
A great source of proteins and fibre, Amarnath grain helps in maintaining a healthy level of triglyceride in your body, that eggs offer.


Replace lactose based fats and butter with coconut butter or coconut oil

Coconut oil is also a medium chain of triglycerides which makes it a better option as it is easy to break down and absorb. Besides, coconut butter is high in amino acids, calcium, and magnesium and is an ideal option for vegan weight watchers as it makes you feel satiated for a prolonged period while attending to your protein requirement.


Replace cheese with nut butters
Peanut, almond, cashew and walnut butter can be another vegan friendly option for people who enjoy their bread with cheese spreads on toasts and sandwiches.

"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,,‘Moviegoers are bored with limited or no entertainment’,"My first memory of watching a film in the theatre was My Dear Kuttichathan in Khammam, Andhra Pradesh. I was six or seven years old when my father took me to the movie, and it’s still fresh in my memory. As my father and grandfather were in the industry, I could even attend preview shows of films, then.

As children, we used to save money to watch films. The process of saving money used to begin several months before the release of films, which I would eagerly wait for. I remember watching Mannan and Baasha like that. For a Deepavali release, we friends, used to start saving money from June-July itself. The ticket rates used to be ` 6 and ` 8 then. We used to go and stand in the queue at 7am for the 11.30am show, but it was super fun, back then.


Once I watched Thalapathi at Udhayam and Guna at Vijaya, back to back, and it was a crazy thing I did. Those days, we could experience the euphoria of Rajini’s mass and Kamal’s class, through their films, and it’s difficult to explain in words. Watching Baasha from Udhayam was another ecstatic experience. For Sarath Kumar sir’s I Love India, five of us went wearing the same colour dress and had so much fun. Similarly, for Nagarjuna’s Hello Brother, I remember dancing in front of the screen whenever the songs were played.

Later, the great theatre experience I had for my film was Mankatha. I watched it at INOX Virugambakkam. Ajith sir’s fans had made it a huge celebration; I couldn’t hear anything for the first five to six minutes. It was special to watch the film with them. Recently, I had a similar experience for Vijay sir’s Sarkar, for the 4am show at GK theatre.
People will return to theatres once they feel they are safe. The regular movie-going crowd is bored at home with limited or no entertainment. They have no other option. Cinema is the cheapest form of entertainment, and hence, the audience will return to movie halls."

"  Nov 1, 2020, 00:00 IST",Deepa Soman,Entertainment,Malayalam cinema once again looks at literature for inspiration,"Next year, Mollywood could see at least five movies releasing, which are based on Malayalam literary works.
While in the past, Malayalam cinema has borrowed extensively from its literature to produce classics such as Odayil Ninnu, Chemmeen and Vidheyan, the past two decades seem to have bucked that trend. However, with movies based on Benyamin’s Aadujeevitham, G R Indugopan’s Vilayath Buddha and Uroob’s Rachiyamma in the works, on Kerala Piravi Day, we find out what’s leading the change and the challenges of adapting literary work to screen.

‘A Book provideS a solid ground to stand on’
One of the most-anticipated, adapted screenplays in Malayalam is that of Aadujeevitham, which has Prithviraj in the lead.
Its director Blessy tells us, “I first thought about making it into a film 11 years ago. A writer-friend and I had a discussion on how in the 70s and 80s, movies had screenplays adapted from literary works of Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Mutthathu Varkey and P Kesavadev, and how by the turn of the millennium, this trend began to cease. The conclusion we arrived at then was that there were immense visual possibilities in the world of movies, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to transpose a literary work to the screen to match that. That’s when I began reading Aadujeevitham and thought the content can provide a cinematic experience.”

Meanwhile, director Shyamaprasad, whose movies including Agnisakshi and Oru Njayarazhcha were based on literary works, says, “Through most of my TV and film life, I have adapted from books, because I feel it is already solid ground to stand on. A book is a different medium from film and I use it as an inspiration but it is not my priority to carry the voice of the author.” His next film Kasiminte Kadal is adapted from Anees Salim’s The Small-Town Sea and features Harish Uthaman, Tashi Shamdat and Arya Salim.

Challenges of choosing a literary work
The themes that now serve as templates for developing the screenplay come from short stories such as Unni R’s Vaanku to novels that are epic in scope as M T Vasudevan Nair’s Randamoozham. Clint director Harikumar has chosen M Mukundan’s short story Autorickshaw-kkarante Bharya for his next film. “I happened to read it in a weekly in 2017. This story about a woman who marries an indolent autorickshaw driver inspired me. However, the content was only enough to make a 30-minute film. So, Mukundan sir and I worked together to add meat to it by introducing characters and events, and shape it into a commercial film,” says Harikumar, about his movie with Suraj Venjaramoodu.

For adapting novels, the process can be even more onerous, says Blessy. “Aadujeevitham is about Najeeb recollecting his experiences in his soliloquy; it’s not a conversation between two people. It’s easier to convey that in a book but depicting a soliloquy onscreen without it being insufferable is tough. So, how the story is told in the film is entirely different. Another task was that in the latter half of the book, even when the Arabab castigates Najeeb in Arabic, the reader reads it in Malayalam; so the book doesn’t address how much the language distresses Najeeb. But in the film, we have to,” says the filmmaker, whose Thanmatra was based on Padmarajan’s short story Orma.

Blessy also explains that movies being a visual medium cannot afford to be vague. “In the book, Benyamin has written that Najeeb couldn’t even find shade under a stick, while describing the heat of the desert. But there’s a masara (a goat farm) in the desert and it will cast a shadow and we can’t eliminate it when showing the visuals. In a literary work, you don’t have to address that because readers travel where the writer takes them, but in a movie, the audience sees it all on screen and can question the logic. Similarly, we have to show the physical transformation that a character undergoes in three years,” he says.

Book vs film comparisons
Every film adaptation of a literary work will eventually be compared to its original source material and the filmmakers are aware of it. “After reading Aadujeevitham, readers have conjured up different images of the deserts and Najeeb’s experiences in their minds. So, as a filmmaker, the most challenging bit for me is to visually present a film that rises above all that,” says Blessy.

Shyamaprasad, however, has a different take. “In adapting a book to film, I believe in conveying its experience to viewers. There is no need to compare the book to the film, as each reader takes away a different experience from a book. When I read Anees Salim’s book, my experience of it evolved from my world vision and each reader has that. I cannot convey through the film what each reader experiences and so I am trying to fulfill what I experience through the book,” he says.



Upcoming movies based on literary works:

Aadujeevitham (Prithviraj)

Vilayath Buddha (Prithviraj)

Autorickshawkkarante Bharya (Suraj Venjaramoodu)

Vaanku (Anaswara Rajan)

Kassiminte Kadal

In an attempt to strengthen the Haryanvi music industry and make it at par with the Punjabi industry, two more leading singers are releasing Haryanavi songs. While these songs, by leading Haryanvi singers, Anu Kadyan and Vicky Kajla had shuttered due to the lockdown, now the singers are ready to roll out their releases. The songs had been planned before the lockdown in March, and had to wait for seven months to be produced and release subsequently. The music video of the song rendered by Vicky Kajla will be a story featuring the singer himself. Kajla's previous songs have been 'Badli Badli Laage' in 2019 that featured Sapna Chaudhary in the music video, and Baraat earlier this year in January, besides 'Heer', also in 2019. The song with Anu will feature Bollywood and Punjabi singer, Dilbagh Singh who has also done Punjabi pop numbers. Some of Anu's previous songs include, 'Bahu Suthri', 'Theke Bain', among others.

There’s a different aura about Aishwarya’s personality. Her on-screen presence has always been cherished and applauded by cinema lovers and fans. She has crafted a niche for herself, and wherever she graces her presence, she leaves an everlasting impression on her audience.


She is also known for her impeccable fashion statement. She always manages to maintain a balance between comfort and style, and can pull off any attire with grace and perfection. On the work front, she was last seen in 'Fanney Khan' co-starring Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao."

"  Nov 1, 2020, 01:00 IST",Abhishek.Shukla2@timesgroup.com,Entertainment,Theatre takes centre stage in Lucknow,"Theatre in Lucknow has always been a talking point not just for Lucknowites but people in different cities also. Lucknowite and theatre director-producer Salim Arif, who has been a part of the Lucknow theatre scene since the 1970s and is known for plays like Taj Mahal Ka Tender, Dil Chahta Hai, among others, on LT’s 25th Anniversary, giving an insight into the theatre scene in the 90s, says, “The 1970s saw a great vitality in the city theatre scene with a constant flow of important plays and individuals from outside that reinvigorated the local audience and performers. But by the 1990s, exposure to the quality theatre from outside in Lucknow became negligible. Ticketed shows at the iconic Ravindralaya gave way to complimentary shows at Rai Umanath Bali Auditorium,” says Arif, adding, “Still theatre stalwarts of the city like Dr Raj Bisaria, Dr Anil Rastogi, Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha and several others continued working with local talent and kept various stages alive with meaningful efforts.”

Telling us how he got well-known theatre artistes to the city, Arif shares, “My early work in Mumbai in TV shows and films introduced me to some great performers who became close personal friends. Those relationships came handy and one could persuade most of them to visit Lucknow with their plays. My friend Zafar Nabi took the responsibility of organising quality theatre shows in Lucknow and we also got support from sponsors and state administration. We had organised Tughlaq in early 80s at Ravindralaya that featured legendary Manohar Singh in his most famous role with great success. This new thrust of shows from outside incidentally coincided with the time when Lucknow Times was introduced with the daily staple of TOI in 1995.”
A scene from the play Brokeback Mountain – an adaptation of the Hollywood film – was much talked about in the city in 2017 (BCCL)
A retired scientist from Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, Dr Anil Kumar Rastogi, who has done more than 1000 shows of around a 100 plays, too shares his experience of how theatre in the city has shaped in the past 25 years.

“Theatre of Lucknow though has been mostly amateur but got national and international recognition when in the late 90s plays of various groups like Darpan, TAW, NIPA, Yayavar, Manchkrati etc participated in the Bharat Rang Mahotsav organized by the National School of Drama, Delhi. Credit also goes to Lucknow when three of its groups Darpan, NIPA and TAW presented their plays in the 8th Theatre Olympics (first in India). NIPA also participated in international festivals held in Norway, Finland and Pakistan with its play Bhagwadajjukiyam,” recalls Rastogi, adding “Theatre in the city in the last 25 years got a big push for two reasons. Many new auditoriums came up during this period. Earlier plays were staged only at Ravindralaya and Mini Ravindralaya at Charbagh. Later, the shifting of Bhartendu Natya Akademi to its new building gave some memorable productions by its founder and subsequent directors and invited guest faculty members but also two auditoriums; BM Shah Auditorium (named after one of its past directors) and Thrust Theatre were also built there. Meanwhile, UP Sangeet Natak Akademi, in its new campus also came up with two new auditoriums.”

Over the years, Lucknow has seen several prominent faces from Bollywood staging their plays in Lucknow. As Arif says, “We could get Naseeruddin Shah to come and perform his Waiting for Godot, Nana Patekar and Ayesha Jhulka came with Purush, a play directed by Vijaya Mehta. It was followed by Khel with Paresh Rawal and Naseeruddin Shah. Jaya Bachchan and Ramesh Talwar came with their play Maa Retire Hoti Hai. In 2002, Ghalibnaama, my musical presentation on letters and poems of Mirza Ghalib was staged at poolside of Taj Hotel. Nadira Babbar with her plays has been a regular visitor to the city on various platforms. Jamila Bai Kalali, by Ila Arun that had Rajit Kapoor and Rajeshwari Sachdev was another play that met with audience approval in the 2000s. He goes on to add, “Subsequently, Bhupesh Rai started the Repertwhar Theatre Festival in Lucknow that got the likes of Lillette Dubey, Makarand Deshpande, Rajat Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Saurabh Shukla, Manav Kaul, Kumud Mishra and others, to come and perform plays on a regular basis.”

Even Rastogi agrees with the point made by Arif that government's support has given a boost to the theatre scene in the city. “Theatre has come a long way since the 90s. Government’s liberal policy of giving production grants to groups and individuals, festival grants, and grants for repertory has played a major role in imporving the theatre scene in the city. Also, Lucknow Times right from its inception 25 years back, helped in big promotion of theatre by giving coverage to plays with audience participation. Kalakaar Association of UP too has been helping UP government in organizing a 10-day theatre festival every year coinciding with Lucknow Mahotsav. Repertwhar is organizing theatre festivals for the last many years with teams invited mostly from Mumbai with productions produced and starring celebrities. Meanwhile, Nisarg and Yayavar are regularly doing workshops,” says Rastogi.

But our director has told us that the Telugu version will be made according to south-Indian nativity. So, my character will be tweaked in keeping with the region,” shares Nabha, adding, “The movie will go on floors by the end of November, so we’ve only had an initial round of discussion on how each of our characters will pan out. But I do know that the makers have some interesting takes on our roles. There might be additional characters, too. The stylist has also just come on board, so the look in the film and other details are still being worked out. Even I’m keen to see how the director will design all the characters in this movie,” sums Nabha. The film stars Nithiin and Tamannaah Bhatia in Ayushmann Khurrana and Tabu’s roles, respectively. Nabha, who made her Kannada film debut with Vajrakaya and followed that up with Lee, has since not been seen in the industry, having established herself in the Telugu industry."

Although the spook-fest was rather low-key across the city this time around, given the ongoing pandemic, a few dared to venture out with their pals and have a fun time. BT was at one such do in the city, which had a minimal guest list, in keeping with safety protocols. While guests arrived kitted out in various spooky outfits, social distancing norms were soon forgotten, as were masks, as they hung out with pals they hadn’t seen in a long time. DJ Rohan, though, never once took off his mask, as he hung out at the console spinning some great tunes."
"  Nov 2, 2020, 00:00 IST",Madhu Daithota,Entertainment,"After Anup Bhandari, Pushkara Mallikarjunaiah announces film on the mythological character, Ashwatthama","It’s not often that two moviemakers get inspired to work on the same theme at the same time. But that seems to have happened with filmmaker Pushkara Mallikarjunaiah and director Anup Bhandari, both of who will be embarking on films whose central character is the mythological legend Ashwatthama.


Been working on the idea for the past two years: Anup

Anup Bhandari who had announced the film in an interview with BT in September, had shared that his film titled Ashwatthama would be a superhero series. “I have been working on the film for the two years now and have finished working on the first half of it,” he had said back then. What’s his take on Pushkara announcing that he will also be making a film on Ashwatthama? “I am not perturbed. I don’t know what their story is and whoever makes it first will probably have a bigger impact. I wish them all the best,” he says.

Our version will have no resemblance to Anup’s film: Pushkara

On Sunday evening, Pushkara hd announced that he would be making a spy thriller starring Shivarajkumar, which will be directed by Sachin B Ravi. “We wanted to announce this film soon after the release of Avane Srimannarayana, but couldn’t do so owing to the pandemic. My plan is to make films on all the immortal characters of Hindu mythology starting with Ashwatthama. And I’m confident that our version will have no resemblance to Anup’s film. In fact, even in Bollywood the makers of Uri had announced that they’d be making a film on Ashwatthama. So, maybe with all our films, the audience will gain a fresh perspective on Ashwatthama each time.”"

"  Nov 2, 2020, 00:05 IST",Harshada Rege,Entertainment,Naseeruddin Shah: Sean Connery was the ONLY Bond for me,"Hailed as the ultimate James Bond, Sean Connery played the suave and macho British Secret Service agent with such finesse and style that the actors who took the franchise ahead often struggled to fit into his suit. The actor headlined seven of the spy thrillers, but that apart, he was also seen in a number of noteworthy films like Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965) Murder On The Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Untouchables (1987) for which he won an Oscar and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989), among others. He retired from acting in 2006. Connery, 90, died peacefully in his sleep in the Bahamas on Saturday.
His final film was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), which was based on the comic book series of the same name by Alan Moore and Kevin O’Neill. The film saw fictional literary characters come together to save the world. While Connery essayed the role of Allan Quatermain, Naseeruddin Shah featured in the movie as Captain Nemo. The actor spoke to Bombay Times about being in awe of the Hollywood actor and his interaction with the legend that left him impressed.

“I saw Dr No when I was in school, I had read a couple of Bond books by then, and I thought Ian Fleming had described Connery — just like one feels that the description of Rhett Butler is actually that of Clark Gable! He was the ONLY Bond for me. My only reason for watching the Bond films after he quit playing the part was because of the actors playing the baddies, not because of who played Bond,” says Naseer.


Sean Connery was known to wear his celebrity status with class and ease. Talking about his interaction with the Hollywood actor while filming The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Naseeruddin Shah says, “I expected him to be a person happy in his own skin and confident enough to not indulge in starry behaviour of any kind and he didn’t disappoint me there! All of us, his co-actors, were certainly in awe of him, but he never displayed any sign of entitled behaviour. He didn’t need to, he was perfectly happy sitting around in his undershirt sans his wig, with us all and scratching himself and breaking wind! He often asked us things about ourselves, which was touching — celebrities are never interested in others, they’re always waiting to be asked things about themselves and are happy to hold forth about themselves even if not asked. Sean was an exception. On the shoot, he’d never leave the set, and even when he wrapped early, would always return after shedding his costume and stay on the floor cueing the other actors, something that is unthinkable for any of our “bankable” stars I would suppose.”


The film’s shoot did have a few hiccups and was met with mixed reactions when it released. Naseer remembers, “The shooting wasn’t fun, it was a heavily CGI dependent film and involved long hours of waiting, and it went on into the bitter Prague winter. Sean and the director (Stephen Norrington), an arrogant unsympathetic upstart who’d made one hit in his life and probably hadn’t even read the books, which the characters in the film were based on, were unfortunately at loggerheads all the time. So, a loaded mood, which occasionally threatened to turn unpleasant, was frequent on the sets. All these problems do show through in the film. I found it pretty unwatchable. Sean deserved a better farewell film.”


The two actors did meet in Las Vegas later. “I met him once after the shoot, at the premiere in Las Vegas, but it would have been too presumptuous to try and stay in touch with him,” shares Naseer.


When asked whether playing James Bond limited Connery’s scope to explore other characters, Naseer opines, “Bond made him a worldwide name and that kind of thing must have negative fallout of some kind sometime so that he will be remembered mostly as Bond, but he had enough guts to not play safe and did manage to explore many acting possibilities. I like all his performances even though his Scottish accent doesn’t leave him, whether he’s playing an Arab or an American! He’s the ultimate ‘personality actor’ like Clint Eastwood though far superior as far as acting abilities go.”"
"  Nov 2, 2020, 00:05 IST",,Entertainment,#TheatreLove: Sanjay Bharathi: I got lathi-charged at the FDFS of Simbu's Vallavan,"While I have watched films on the day of their release and attended movie premieres with my dad, I had my first first-day-first-show experience when I was in Class 12. The film was Vallavan (2006). Simbu was coming off the superhit Manmadhan and was debuting as a director then, so expectations were sky-high. I watched the film in Kamala theatre, and there was a crazy crowd. It was almost like that scene in Mannan, in which Rajini and Goundamani try to buy tickets. There was a delay as the print had not arrived and the crowd became unmanageable. The police had to resort to lathi charge and I got hit even though my friends and I were standing in a corner. Adding to the excitement was the fact that Simbu and director Shankar had come to the watch the film. When the film began, the cheers were so loud you could hardly hear a thing. And Simbu’s confrontation scenes with Reema Sen got such a great response. I don’t think I can ever forget this experience.


My next FDFS experience was with the film Rajinikanth's Sivaji. If Vallavan was 100 times crazy, this one was 1,000 times crazier than that.


Watching a movie in theatres has a whole different vibe. I am someone who prefers to watch films in theatres. And 90 per cent of the time, I’d go to a film alone. Even though I am a director now, when I watch a film for the first time in the theatre, I watch it like a lay audience, totally immersing myself in the film’s world. During the lockdown, I was never able to do that while watching a movie on OTT.

I’m very happy that theatres are all set to reopen. And I’m super excited that they are reopening on November 10, which also happens to be my birthday. That way, it is a double delight for me. I might not go to the theatre to watch a rerun of an old film, but I will definitely visit a movie hall once a new movie releases."

The legendary star who kickstarted his career from television series before finally making his debut with 'Deewana' in 1992 has also completed a journey of 28 golden years in the film industry this year.

While he is popular mainly for his romantic roles in films like 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,' 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,' and 'Mohabbatein,' here are four of King Khan's power-packed non-romantic roles on his 55th birthday.

1. The obsessive stalker in 'Darr'

While a majority of female fans of the actor would want him to enact his iconic open arm pose for them, his character of an obsessive stalker in Yash Chopra's 'Darr,' has been sending chills down the spine for many moviegoers.

Khan's character from 'Darr' is one of the very few villainous roles portrayed by him in his entire film career. The role continues to be a benchmark even after 27 years of the film's release.


2. The NASA scientist in 'Swades'

The character of Mohan Bhargava from Ashutosh Gowariker's 'Swades' is a reminder for everyone busy in their fast-moving lives to stop and appreciate their roots.

The terrific tale of the NASA scientist who returns to his native village in India to take his nanny to America and in turn rediscovers a bond with his nation won SRK a Filmfare award as the best actor.


3. The failed hockey player turned coach in 'Chak De! India'

As much as the film's title track is known for giving goosebumps to patriotic souls, the plot of the movie is known for bringing the issue of sexism, and racism in Indian sports to the forefront.

The power-packed delivery of the 'Sattar Minute' dialogue by Khan from the movie coupled with his intense portrayal of the sportsman deeply passionate about hockey and his country continues to win hearts after 13 years of its release.


4. Man with Asperger syndrome in 'My Name Is Khan'

The Karan Johar directorial based on the life of a San Franciso-based autistic Muslim man and his fight with religious prejudice following the September 11 terrorist attacks is considered to be one of the best films dealing with the issue of religious bigotry.


The heart-wrenching journey of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) to meet and tell the then American President that his last name is Khan and he is not a terrorist won him another Filmfare.


The megastar has a total of 14 Filmfare Awards and he was bestowed by the Government of India with Padma Shri for his contribution to Indian cinema in 2005.


Khan was last seen in Aanand L Rai's 'Zero' alongside Anushka Sharma in 2018."

The actress has been regularly sharing pictures from all the ceremonies, giving her fans a glimpse of what went behind planning a wedding in the pandemic.
Ambika Gupta, a Chennai-based luxe event designer, who planned the big wedding, says, “I had zero connections to either Kajal or Gautam before the wedding. But we did have a link - Ami Patel, who styled Kajal, is a friend. She has styled some of my high-profile clients in the south and we share a good bond. I was talking about promoting my wedding section in Instagram when she said she was going to be styling a celebrity and wanted to promote the bride section on her page, too. She then said she was going to pass on my contact to them, in case they wanted a planner. I shot a dart in the dark because I had thought that they would have somebody on board because the wedding was just a month away. But turns out, they had decided on the date only recently. I knew it was Kajal only when I was contacted by Nisha, her sister.”

Talking about how she became a part of the wedding, Ambika says, “Nisha and I spoke on September 26, I guess, and instantly struck a chord. She asked me to share some of my recent work and I sent her a few site images of the lockdown wedding I did in Chennai. She liked them but asked if I would be able to manage it from Chennai, while the wedding was happening in Mumbai. I told her I wanted them to have confidence in me, and since I have done events worldwide, including Serbia and Bali, I knew I could make this work. Moreover, I was frequenting Mumbai to check out costumes for one of my brides. That’s how I met Kajal and Gautam in Bombay on around October 3. We had less than a month to put together the whole wedding.”
Ambika says both Kajal and Gautam were equally invested in the planning. “Gautam also has an eye for designing. So, he sweetly gave me inputs,” she smiles.

A socially responsible wedding

Both Kajal and Gautam’s households stuck to all the regulations laid down by the Maharashtra government while planning their wedding. “There were just family and close friends at all the events, and they stuck to the number of guests advised by the government. In fact, they had all moved into the hotel where the wedding was to be held two days before the events. They were first swab-tested and only those who were negative for COVID-19 attended the events. The functions were held at two properties, which were right next to Kajal’s home in Mumbai. She has elders in her family – her grandmom’s in her 90s – and she has also shoots planned out for later this year. So, the couple wanted to be socially responsible and took safety as priority,” says Ambika.

When Kajal and Gautam filled out a questionnaire

Ambika says the venues were customized to Kajal and Gautam’s tastes, and that’s what stood out. “I believe no two people can have the same story. I wanted to personalize the theme according to their likes. So, I made them fill out a form; they answered questions like how they met, what colours they like in their living room, what colours they like on themselves, what patterns they like, etc,” she laughs.

An auspicious beginning

Kajal kickstarted the celebrations mid-October with a Radha-Krishna pooja at her residence. “The theme was Brijvasi Krishna Bagh, inspired by Radha-Krishna paintings that depict them standing under a tree,” says Ambika, “We had a tree of peonies and done them up in cascading shades of pink, with origami birds and brass bells hanging from them. The entire house was done up in flowers, peacock feathers and flutes. A wooden swing she has at her balcony was also done up in florals and greens.”

The Tamil Nadu connect

The haldi, held at a bistro, had a south Indian set-up. “We wanted to highlight her south connection and chose Kitsch Mandi: The Artisans of India as the theme. Since she is a Punjabi, Ami had done her outfit in the form of a patiala, but from south Indian weaves. The backdrop was done using palm leaves, handpainted pettis (used by coconut farmers to hold tools while they climb trees) and banana leaves. The bistro had black and white chequered floors, very similar to the Chettinad-style tiling. So, we used that space to give it a south Indian touch,” says Ambika, adding, “There was a haldi, followed by chunni chadai ceremony, dhol ceremony and a lot of dancing. She had a costume change before the Gaur Pooja.”

She says they had a ‘bee’ theme as a second option for the haldi. “Most of the hampers had gingham bees on them. So, she wanted that to be extended to the venue set-up. But I felt it didn’t add to their events and suggested the south Indian theme. I showed everything to her on a CD mock-up and once she saw what was envisioned, she said yes,” says Ambika.

Talking about the petti, she says, “Photographer Amar Ramesh was doing a project on pettis at a farm in Tamil Nadu. I happened to see his work and told him I wanted to use it at one of my events. So, when I got to work on Kajal’s wedding, I thought I should use it here because she has such a strong south connect. Plus, making petti is a dying art form and she strongly believes in local businesses. So, we got farmers to make the pettis for us, and we handpainted them. She also paid the farmers in her own, sweet way.”

While Kajal had her mehendi ceremony two days before the wedding, her family and friends had it on the day of the haldi.

An ode to Kashmir

As for the wedding, it had a Kashmiri theme – Shikara: A Voice Of Love. Ambika says, “Since Kajal is going to Gautam’s family, who are from Kashmir, we wanted to make it look like she was on a shikara boat on a river, going to Kashmir. So, we did the venue with pyramid structures - they depict the valleys of Kashmir, and are a symbol of integration of self and soul. The mandap had intricate details of the shikara boat, the panelling was inspired by the shikara’s windows. We also had blue panels, which are inspired by Pashmina patterns. We used mirror flooring to create an illusion of water, and the side tables had flowers, depicting the floating flower market of Kashmir. We had placed bells on each table, which were rung every time they took a phera (circle around the agni).”

Speeches and an impromptu flash mob

Post the wedding, the guests gave speeches and broke into impromptu performances. “One of their violinist friends performed and blessed the couple. There was even a flash mob, and the friends first performed to Spice Girls’s Wannabe! We had a cake-cutting event and even popped fruit champagne. We didn’t go for real champagne because it’s not allowed,” says Ambika, adding, “We removed the chairs and cleared up the mandap to make space on the stage. We didn’t have much turnaround time, but the earlier setting lent itself up beautifully to the performances. All elders and kids also danced and we had fun till the wee hours of the morning.”

Hampers for colleagues

Kajal and Gautam had shared a link with their family who couldn’t make it to the wedding so that they could catch the ceremony live. “They are also getting beautiful hampers made in Mumbai and Delhi for all of Kajal’s work friends. It’s their way to show how much they missed them at the wedding, but couldn’t invite them over, given the pandemic. The couple is planning to host a reception next year, depending on how the COVID-19 situation is,” tells Ambika, adding, “Nisha also distributed boxes of sweets to the press who had gathered outside the venue. She also apologized for not posing for pictures and for being understanding.”


When Ambika turned emcee


For Ambika, the wedding is special for more reasons than one. “I’ve formed a bond with the entire family, and I feel the universe made this happen. I had no connection with them when I started out, but I hope I have formed a lifelong relationship. Uncle (Kajal’s father) is very protective of his family, but he warmed up to me so well. And aunty would give me blessings and gifts. She is the calming force in the family. I’d have dinners with them whenever I went to their home, and they treated all of us, my team, like family,” she says, adding, “I generally don’t do the planning, and only collaborate with planners. But Nisha wanted me to do the whole thing. They treat everyone with love and respect. And they have a lot of confidence in you once they trust you with a job. In fact, Nisha made me emcee the wedding at the last minute. I feel this was the most amazing thing that has happened in the last few months.”"
"  Nov 3, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,TV,Gouthami Jadav makes telly comeback in a macho avatar in Sathya,"Gouthami Jadav, who was last seen onscreen in the 2012 popular Kannada serial Nagapanchami, is making a comeback to telly with an “extremely different role and a macho avatar”. In the time since Nagapanchami, Gouthami has been dabbling with films, and was in Looty, Aadhya and Kinaare. She even did a Tamil film called Santhoshathil Kalavaram (2018). Her return to TV has the actress super excited. ""I started my career in television back in 2012, after which I moved to movies. I was on the lookout for a suitable project on TV and that’s when I got a call to audition for the title role in Sathya. Luckily I cracked the audition,"" she says.

The character, adds Gouthami, is not only interesting, but also poles apart from how she is in real life. ""I generally avoid conflict and my body language is more feminine and docile. I do not curse or use slang language. But Sathya is this bold girl who fights for what is right and does have a manly disposition,"" she says. So, was it tough to get into the character? ""Oh yes, it was difficult for me to get into the character. For instance, I am not too adept at riding a two-wheeler, given that I have been doing it only for about a year, but for the character, I not only have to ride a two-wheeler but that too the heavier geared versions. This role is truly letting me learn a lot,"" she says, adding that the character will mostly be seen in jeans and T-shirts.


Promos for the serial, which is yet to air, have been doing the rounds and the response, says Gouthami has been good. ""The teaser was well-appreciated given that the story is about a strong no-nonsense girl, who fights for what she believes is right. It’s a female-centric story and explores the concept of women being at par with men in today's world,"" she says."

The last time I was on a shooting location was for Raymo, shortly before the lockdown was imposed. Honestly, after months of not acting, I almost thought I forgot the craft,” laughs Karunya, adding, “I have now joined the set of director Vijaya Prasad’s Petromax. His films always tend to have characters that are all significant to the narrative, which is why I accepted the offer. My character is rather quirky and has three distinct shades, which is new for me. One of the highlights of the film is the dialogues, some of which involve my character and are quite entertaining. The second schedule of shoot will begin in Mysuru in December.” Petromax has Sathish Ninasam, Hariprriya, Arun and Nagabhushan in prominent roles. In Pavan Wadeyar's Raymo, which has Ishan and Ashika Ranganath, Karunya has an interesting cameo.

Karan, who shot to fame with his vector image of lord Hanuman in 2017, has been regularly notching up thousands of likes and shares on social media for his works. The Bengaluru-based artist is currently working out of his family home in Kudlu, Kasargod, and receives over 2,000 requests a day from various folks who wish to see their dreams represented in colour. “The common man is my muse. So, whether it is a sketch of somebody’s deceased brother who was in the army and wishes to see them in uniform, someone who wants to see their special-needs child as lord Krishna or another who wishes to see how his grandfather looked like originally by sending me a side profile image, I’ve painted them all. Some are requests, others I sketch or paint when I’m inspired,” says Karan. However, it’s his recent work depicting a heavily-pregnant Meghana Raj Sarja at her seemantha with her late husband Chiranjeevi Sarja by her side that has warmed the cockles of people’s hearts. “I saw the pictures of Meghana at the ceremony with a cutout of Chiranjeevi next to her and something stirred within me. Their fans, too, sent me requests to give it my own touch. My wife was also moved by that image and told me to paint something beautiful to capture the poignancy of that moment. So, I made this art of Chiranjeevi as a groom holding his expectant beloved,” states Karan. “This is the first time I’ve ventured to capture the emotions of a celebrity couple. I hope I’ve been able to do justice to the occasion. I am someone who believes that each person’s life story is unique. And that is my biggest inspiration as an artist,” sums up Karan."

But its reception has been far from warm, if you were to go by the comments on the show’s social media page. Viewers have been trolling the show and its stars. “Heroine makeup over agide (the heroine is loaded with makeup); hero and heroine ge acting baralla, change maadi (the hero and heroine can’t act, please change them), and other comments along these lines are a common feature on the page.

Aravind, though, is unperturbed. “Every action, whether in reel or real-life, has an over-reaction on social media,” he states. “When I launched the serial, I was clear that my lead pair would be different from the regular ones you see on Kannada television. They will not subscribe to the normal notions of the tall, dark and handsome hero or an elaborately made-up heroine in gaudy clothes. Both Mayuri and Shashank are consummate actors who are like the average boy and girl you see on the streets. Audiences are so attuned to seeing the typical serial hero and heroine on TV that they are still getting used to a lead pair that looks like average folk,” explains Aravind, adding, “Besides, 90% of these trolls are fake profiles. They are just targeting us for the sake of it. So, I don’t really care for such people.”


The director tells us that Mayuri has found a lot of love from the 50-plus audience, especially women. “And that’s the kind of acceptance we like. Shashank, too has been lauded for his acting. So, these online comments don’t hold any relevance,” wraps Aravind."

His grandson Yuva Rajkumar's debut film's title was revealed in a unique manner and has garnered a lot of praise. Titled Yuva Ranadheera Kanteerava, the film, which is a historical drama, will be helmed by debutant Puneeth Rudranag. Yuva's act in the five-minute-long special video has been appreciated by all, and his histrionics many say, are reminiscent of his grandfather. ""I'm extremely happy and can't find the right words to express my emotions for this comparison. He is my biggest inspiration for everything in life,"" says Yuva about being compared to his grandfather, adding that he is hoping to live up to it. Yuva is also aware that this means expectations will be high. ""I know there are expectations from me. This was one of the reasons why we wanted to show the audience how the film is going to look. The process of making the film will take time, so we wanted to introduce it and the team in the presentation,"" he explains.

The actor admits that the teaser video faced delays because of the pandemic. ""We had shot this in March, just before the lockdown. After that, since everything was closed, there was a slight delay in the post production. Eventually, everything worked out fine and we got to introduce the concept and the title of our film on the right day - Karnataka Rajyotsava,"" he says.

Yuva says that this video is to showcase how this historical could look on screen, adding that they would be mounting it on a much bigger canvas. As for the story, he reveals, ""We do have a small essence of a true story, something which has not been said before on screen. Of course, we will definitely add a cinematic touch to it.""

Yuva further explains that he has been prepping a lot for the film, and there will be more from his side. As for the film going on floors, he shares, ""We are in the pre-production phase. We are finalising the screenplay and will soon begin with casting. We would like to go on floors as soon as possible and hope to finish the film by the end of next year."""

"  Nov 3, 2020, 00:10 IST",Sruthi Raman,,"‘For me, films are all about the theatrical experience’","My first memorable experience of watching a film in the theatre is Rajini sir’s Baashaa in Kanchipuram as a boy. My dad was in Kanchipuram at that time and I was with him. That was an incomparable feeling, which I will keep in my mind. It was a first-day-first-show screening. It is a kind of film that you can watch countless times. The style, dialogue-delivery and the feeling of mass that the film evoked is something that stands the test of time. It has been a long time since I had an experience like that in the theatre.

There are two other two experiences that I can never forget. The first one is the time I watched Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu with my family at Sangam theatre. Watching my first film in an FDFS with the public was an unforgettable experience. I was anxious and scared, but the response to the first show from the audience was brilliant.


Another experience was Ratsasan. The audiences were so involved in the experience that they were reacting to every sequence aloud. For instance, they were scolding my character and Kaali's character during nail-biting sequences. They were so engrossed in the film. That was remarkable for all of us. We knew that we had made a good film, but we did not expect people to enjoy the sequences to that extent. We, especially, did not expect family audiences to connect to a psychological thriller. The entire vibe of the theatre was something I have never witnessed in any of my other movies.

When we started our careers, 10 years ago, it was all about the big screen. Today, we have Tik Tok stars and YouTube stars, apart from OTT stars. But back then, the term ‘star’ would denote an actor starring in cinema. So, for me, films are all about the theatrical experience."

So, to suddenly go to another city seemed like a strange thing to do. But deep inside, I had been waiting to shoot. I mean, this is my life. Now that I’ve started working, I am having a great time,” begins the actress. She is glad her routine has become sorted now. “And it feels amazing. Earlier, I used to sleep late, wake up late, spent my time doing what I felt like. But now, I am in my bed latest by 10pm and up by 5am. I’m feeling recharged, rejuvenated,” she says, adding that the production team has put her anxiety to rest by taking care of safety measures at the shooting spot.

“We are very careful and strict about using masks, washing and sanitising hands often. We are also being tested every week. I feel very safe,” she states. During the lockdown, Nidhhi took Tamil lessons. Ask her if it’s coming in handy now and she says with a laugh, “Absolutely, and I’m happy I decided to learn Tamil. It has helped me quite a bit while shooting for this film. It’s easier to remember my lines now, and I’m able to communicate with people better. I’m getting better at the language, and soon, I will speak Tamil fluently.”


So, what’s her role like in the film? “It’s a fun character, very different from what I did in Bhoomi, and I’m enjoying playing the role,” says Nidhhi with a laugh, adding that this is all she can reveal now. But the youngster is all praise for her director and co-star. “This film is set against a rural backdrop. Working with Susienthiran sir, a National Award-winning director, is a learning experience. Simbu is an amazing dancer, actor and is so good with stunt sequences. I feel I can learn a lot from them and have a good time shooting, too,” she signs off."

The two had a big fight over a task and things had turned ugly.
However, in the Weekend Ka Vaar episode, host Salman Khan had pointed out that she had overreacted and Rahul Vaidya acted in the spirit of the game.

Jasmin was seen speaking to Rahul and asked him if he kept his ego and attitude aside. The duo has a heart-to-heart talk where Jasmin apologises to Rahul. She says, “I am sorry, maybe I misunderstood. But you also triggered my feelings saying continuously that I am giving a performance. I was hurt. You also didn’t once come and apologise to me. You have hurt my mental and emotional state. But I am sorry. I accept when Salman Sir said that your intent was not what I had assumed. I will not become small if I apologise.”
Jasmin goes on to explain to him what she had felt and poured her heart out.

Rahul says, “I had no idea what was going on in your mind and how you had perceived it. And if you think that I was not affected, then you are wrong.”


Jasmin blames the miscommunication between them. However, Rahul says that he is happy that she is saying sorry from heart. He further says that he did not apologise earlier as he did not feel sorry. Rahul then goes to apologise to Jasmin. He also adds that he is happy to see she took the initiative and calls her ‘TV ki Katrina Kaif’.


Jasmin says she needed to heal by expressing her feelings. Rahul and Jasmin shake hands and end their conversation on a positive note.

Excerpts from a quick chat with Amrita.
How would you describe the feeling of holding your baby in your arms?
I can’t stop staring at my baby’s face and my husband Anmol’s priceless expression of joy. I’m still in a state of wonderment. The phenomenon of giving birth to another human being is unfathomable and divine. There is a God realisation that nothing is in your hands and control. This baby was meant to come this year, so yay… I’m a #2020 mom!

So, you are all geared up for your new role...
That I have to play the role of a mother is yet to sink in because I’m such a mumma’s girl myself. If I begin to compare myself with my mom, then it’s too big shoes to fill in, so I’d rather just enjoy the feeling of having a little wonder in my life to keep me on my toes.

Have Anmol and you decided on a name for your baby?
Not yet. We have shortlisted a few names, but are still in the process of finalising one.


A pregnancy in 2020 given the pandemic situation might not have been easy. How did you manage?
Yes, 2020 is a difficult year. However, if I look at the silver lining, then I think there were many fringe benefits of conceiving in 2020. My baby got only pure home-cooked food, as both the grandmothers pitched in and took turns to stay with us. A nuclear family suddenly became a joint family. The bonding, spending quality time, having family conversations, eating together, praying together and enjoying planning the ‘little things’ together will surely inculcate such sanskars in my baby, too.


Not many people knew you were expecting until a few weeks ago when we spotted you with a bump at a clinic. How did you keep your pregnancy a secret?
(Laughs!) My body showed no signs of pregnancy weight except for the baby bump. I’ve got to thank my genes for that. And guess what? When my ninth month pregnancy pictures came out, a lot of my friends didn’t call to wish me thinking it was just a rumour and that I was sporting a baby bump for a shoot!


Talking about shooting, when do you plan to resume work?
On the work front, the lockdown came as a boon. I didn’t miss out on any work due to pregnancy. In fact, there have been some very interesting offers post August that I’m looking forward to taking up January onwards."

As the fraternity and music connoisseurs remember him fondly, Dr L Subramaniam writes about his memories of the stalwart…
When I was in school, my father often spoke about some of the most well-known violinists of that era, including Rajamanickam Pillai, Papa Venkataramaiah, Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu and Mysore T Chowdiah. He also mentioned the name of a young violinist who had made quite a mark for himself by accompanying stalwarts such as Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer even as a teenager. That was Prof TN Krishnan.

He learnt violin from his father, Narayana Iyer, who was a visionary. TN Krishnan and his siblings, N Rajam and TN Mani, were all accomplished violinists. While TN Krishnan made his mark in the field of Carnatic music, N Rajam became one of the important violinists of Hindustani music and TN Mani contributed a great deal for films.
My father used to know Sri Narayana Iyer well and later on, I also had the privilege of meeting and knowing Prof T N Krishnan. He was such a soft-spoken man who peppered his talk with subtle humour. He was always immaculately dressed and the moment he entered a room, all eyes would be on him. He was a meticulous person, spoke well and presented his art in a dignified manner, without any pomp or getting into any sort of controversy. It is little wonder that he had such an enduring career spanning several decades, playing both accompaniment and solo. I am deeply saddened by the demise of one of the last musicians of that generation.


It is noteworthy that Prof TN Krishnan’s family has taken forward the violin tradition. He taught his children Viji and Sriram, both of whom are accomplished musicians. TN Mani’s daughter, Kala Ramnath, and N Rajam’s daughter, Sangeetha Shankar, are both well-known violinists of Hindustani music. Even their next generation has taken up the violin.


In January 2020, before the Covid-19 chaos, we had the honour of giving the Lakshminarayana Global Music Award to Prof TN Krishnan. At the awards ceremony, he played a short concert with his daughter Viji and I was amazed at the fluent manner in which he played in spite of his advanced age. It was perhaps the last concert he played. That was also the last time I spoke to him and I cherish the conversation we had.


Several awards were bestowed on Prof Krishnan, which he richly, richly deserved. Whenever anyone talks about Indian violin, he will always be remembered. His death is an irreparable loss to the world of music. And personally, I have lost a great friend and a senior colleague whom I have admired for several years."

I always make it a point to catch the FDFS of Thalapathy Vijay, Thala Ajith and Thalaivar Rajinikanth’s films.

The experience of watching a film in a theatre is a surreal ride. It just takes you to a different world altogether and it is magical. The entire experience somehow makes all of us in the theatre as one entity. It’s the power of such a collective experience is what makes the big screen experience incomparable.


The experience of watching myself on screen with audiences appreciating my work is another high in itself. This was especially the case when I watched the FDFS of Tamizh Padam 2 with a packed crowd. The audience enjoyed each and every scene, the way we expected them to.

My last release was Naan Sirithal and thankfully it had released right before the initial lockdown. I watched it with my team and my parents. I do feel nervous and jittery before watching myself on screen, but it is such a rewarding feeling when people collectively enjoy a film that you are associated with."

When we dug around, we learnt that it was because he was suffering from migraine and had to seek medical help.

However, the condition had become a little serious recently and he didn’t even come out of his room for three days.

Cutting down on all the added sugar from your diet for a specific period of time is called sugar detox. While this process is beneficial for many, the best way is to focus on reducing added sugar intake for life and not just for a time period.

‘It is Always better to have sweets as snacks, not after a heavy meal’
Eliminating all the refined forms of sugar from your diet will go a long way in keeping you healthy. Avoid sugar, coconut sugar and palm sugar. Try natural sugar, like raisins and dates, instead. Never look at your favourite food as a cheat meal. Gorging on sweets in the festive season is fine but instead of ordering in, you can have homemade ones. You can make paneer-based fondue, apple or oats halwa. It’s always better to eat sweets as snacks rather than after a heavy meal. — Riddhima Batra, nutritionist

‘It’s the best lifestyle choice I have ever made’
It’s been several years that I have completely cut off sugar from my diet and that has been the best lifestyle choice I have ever made. I think having sweets or refined sugar is more harmful than fried foods. With sugar detox, I have noticed positive changes. I have acne-prone and oily skin. The skin texture seems much better now. Also, my hair fall problems have stopped. At times, during festivities, when I badly crave for sweets, I just take a small bite. I can’t imagine myself having an entire sandesh, chocolate bar or even a bowl of ice cream. For people, who are suffering from insomnia, they should completely stop having sugar post 6 pm. I do not add sugar to my regular tea or coffee. I replace sugar with either organic honey or a piece of jaggery.

Benefits of sugar detox
Helps you lose weight: The most obvious benefit is weight loss. Sugar can be replaced with nutritious and whole foods like fruits (lemons, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, kiwis, grapefruit, avocado and watermelon) and vegetables (lettuce, tomato, beetroot, cabbage and broccoli). Sugar detox will
make you fell less bloated and more energetic. It will improve hormone levels and slim down your waistline.
Improves complexion and skin tone: Consuming food high in sugar content leads to hormonal imbalance and in turn affects your complexion and skin tone. Sugar detox can help the skin look younger, beautiful and firm. It also contributes to an even skin tone and healthy complexion.

‘Your skin gets a natural glow with sugar detox’
I have consciously cut off consuming refined sugar for quite some time now. But on some cheat meal days, I do indulge in some chocolates or pastries, as I have a sweet tooth. The immediate effect that I noticed after following sugar detox is that the bloating in the body reduces. You start looking leaner and your skin also gets a natural glow. I have never experienced low energy levels after I have stopped having sugar. Also, as a substitute to sugar, I do mix honey in my green tea often.
— Paayel Sarkar
Higher energy levels: Who said sugar detox will lower down the energy levels in your body? Rather, health experts say that intake of sugar spikes up the energy in your body momentarily and makes you feel all drained out and extremely tired later on. Cutting out on all types of sugar from your diet will help you feel twice as energetic for an extended period of time. Its impact can be seen during your daily workout regimen. Sugar detox helps burn more fat and exercise more efficiently.

‘I often replace sugar with organic honey’
I generally avoid sugar and sugary food all year round, but I do have occasional cheat meals, especially desserts, like ice creams, cakes and pastries. During Durga Puja, I did gorge on some of those delicious desserts but now since the celebrations are over, I am back to my regimen, which is pretty intense. I have completely cut down on sugar and my major source of energy comes from protein, complex carbs and fats. I am trying to eat as clean as possible and I must say it feels really good, both physically and mentally. While maintaining my strict diet, I often replace sugar with organic honey.

Improves digestion: Digestive problems are at bay if you are eating a healthy and nutritious diet on a regular basis. Giving up on food high in sugar content will not cause issues like gas, bloating, feeling of nausea, acidity and indigestion in your body.


‘I ensure my cravings are restricted to weekly cheat meals only’

I have mostly been off sugar since July last year. But being a true-blue Bengali, I have a sweet tooth. However, I ensure my cravings are restricted to weekly cheat meals only. This helps me enjoy my favourite rasmalai at times, while keeping a check on calories I consume. During festive seasons, my diet takes a backseat and I let myself just go with the flow. However, that leads to stricter diets in the following weeks and I don’t miss my workout sessions. My personal trainer at the gym is of huge help when it comes to getting rid of those extra inches I add

during the festive season.

Reduces risk of diabetes: Diabetes is one of the biggest health concerns faced by millions across the globe. The primary thing to ward off diabetes is to cut off sugar completely from your diet, which in turn will keep you fit and help you lose some extra pounds. Intake of sugar rich food can increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes."
"  Nov 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,TV,Deepika Das represented her school at the state level for kabaddi and shot put,"Actress Deepika Das, who is best known for her role in the television series Naagini and also her stint on Bigg Boss Kannada, is quite the sports lover. In fact, the actress has even won medals in kabaddi at the state level. It was no wonder then, that Deepika was good at tasks when she was in the Bigg Boss Kannada house. Deepika says, ""As a kid, I was very athletic and into sports. I was the captain of the kabaddi team and have represented my school at the state level, and even won medals for the same. Till date, kabaddi remains my favourite sport. I always watch the matches and even follow the kabaddi league. I also played shot put and represented my school at the state level,"" says the actress.
The actress adds that it wasn't always a smooth sailing boat for her. ""Kabaddi can be a very rough sport and there was a time when my parents didn't allow me to play kabaddi. Once, I had bruised my knees so badly, that though I tried covering the marks with my skirt, my parents saw them and got worried. My mother told me that she didn't want me to play the game. But I managed to convince her and continued to play right through my school,"" says the actress, adding, ""Even today, given a chance to play any sport, I jump at the opportunity. In fact, I was looking forward to learning to play football, but couldn't because of the pandemic."""
"  Nov 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Rajshri Ponnappa is set to get married in 2021,"Actress Rajshri Ponnappa is quite excited. The actress recently took to social media to share that she had said 'yes' and hinted at her engagement. Rajshri revealed to us that the lucky man is Adhir Bhat, an economics graduate from London and a writer in Bollywood, who has been a part of many hit films and shows. She added that the families have met informally and she is now set to get married next year. ""I can't pinpoint how and when exactly we began our love story, but I will just say this - he swept me off my feet with his intellect. We have known each other through common friends. I knew he was trying to woo me. It was when I watched his play Dhoomrapan that I fell in love with his mind. Though, it was not an instant proposal after that,"" Rajshri shares.

The families of Rajshri and Adhir met in Kashmir recently to formalise the relationship and talk marriage. ""Both our families and our mutual friends were always rooting for us to get together and when Adhir popped the question, I said yes obviously. We are now looking at tying the knot sometime in July 2021 if things go to plan,"" Rajshri says, adding that they also have plans of collaborating professionally, since the former has a content creation company in Mumbai and Rajshri has her presence across different industries in India."
"  Nov 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",Ashish Ittyerah Joseph,Lifestyle,Kanyakumari to Kashmir: Duo covers it on a tandem bicycle,"I n 18 days 18 hours and 46 minutes, 3849km is what I and Robert Kingsly covered as we cycled from Kanyakumari to Kashmir,” starts Meera Velankar. Robert, who works in a car company in Chennai, and Meera, who lives in Bangalore, started their expedition on October 10 from Kanyakumari and completed it in Srinagar on October 28. When many cycling events got cancelled due to the pandemic, this duo decided to do one on their own. For 44-year-old Meera, she says, it was the uniqueness of this expedition that gave her the kick. “I am up for anything if it’s a first-of-a-kind. This was the first time anyone did tandem cycling, covering this route and distance.”

Meera adds, “The popular ride K2K is generally from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.” But Robert (39) and Meera reversed the route — they cycled from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. “It happened so because our flight to Kashmir got cancelled. But eventually, we did a tougher expedition. Because we had to do all the elevation towards the end of our ride,” says Meera.


Until this expedition, Meera says, the duo had only been acquaintances. “My usual tandem partner, Rafi, wasn’t available and the other cyclists I knew were mostly fast riders, not endurance riders. I had met Robert only at a few randonneuring events. I knew he was a good endurance rider and he readily agreed when I asked him. His preparation for this ride was so rigorous; he would do 200 push-ups a day.”

Robert chips in, “Everything was planned by Meera, including coordinating with people at various places of halt. All I did was modify my tandem bicycle so that it would be comfortable for a male and female combination to ride.”

When Meera participated in Super Randonneurs in 2017, tandem cycling was new in India. However, she chose to switch to tandem cycling because of safety concerns. “Whenever I had to cover 400km-500km in randonneuring events, I used to be absolutely traumatised, followed by men. But I could cover those intense routes with Rafi without any pressure on a tandem bicycle,” she says, adding, “And this tandem expedition was great. Robert is a great endurance rider, but an even better human being. Without him, I wouldn’t have been able to complete it. He would follow all my instructions, like the nutritional supplements we had to take daily, sanitiising hands regularly, etc.” Roberts adds, “It was like tandem cycling with an elder sister.”


The duo says they were touched by how members from various cycling groups took care of them at different locations. “Some let us stay with them without any apprehension even during this time of COVID-19. The people we came across along the way would take down our contact details and call back a few days later to check if we were safe. In our last stretch from Ramban to Banihal, we came across army men. We interacted with them and they even shared with us the hot noodles they had prepared. We realised that they live in such difficult conditions and serve the country,” says Meera.


So, what next? “Now, I only have family on my mind; they have been very supportive. Maybe the Golden Quadrilateral, connecting four major cities — Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Delhi — would be the next one for now. A few international events, too, are on cards,” she signs off."

"  Nov 4, 2020, 00:00 IST",,TV,Bigg Boss 14: Nikki Tamboli hides oxygen mask in her pants; opponent Rahul Vaidya calls her ‘gutter’,"In the latest episode of Bigg Boss 14, housemates gear up for the nomination task. The contestants are given a task to be played in pairs and save themselves from the nominations.
Each pair sits on a spaceship-created area and then debate as to why one should be safe and in the green zone of the house, while the other should be nominated and be restricted in the red zone. A mask on the table will decide their fate. As per the red, yellow and green signals, the contestants have to ensure that they retain the mask in their hand to make their way into the green zone.

The first pair called on the stage is Nikki Tamboli and Rahul Vaidya. Eager to escape the nominations, Nikki takes the mask in her hand even before the game begins. Rahul, who then asks her to talk it out with him, argues saying she took the mask before the game starts, hence she should keep it on the desk and then play it as a task. Nikki argues saying if she is wrong Bigg Boss will interrupt and this is her way of playing.
Rahul begs in front of her. When the red buzzer hits, Rahul tries to snatch it from her and they wrestle for the mask. During this, Rahul warns Nikki saying ‘Cheena-Jhapti hogi’ and after a while he tells her, to not play dirty. The mask’s wire breaks and Nikki keeps it in her pants.


All the contestants seem to be against Nikki. Rahul gives with Nikki holding the mask to herself. Later, Rahul seems to be extremely upset for not giving him a fair chance. He calls her ‘gutter’. Nikki also hits back saying she knows how to play the games and this is how she will play it. It is her choice and she will do whatever it takes to be in the game. She also says that as she is physically weak than Rahul she came up with this idea.


The whole house suddenly turns against Nikki and demeans her for taking such a step, while Nikki being Nikki sportingly takes the backlash and sticks to her ground, still believing that everything is fair in love and war. While Pavitra calls Nikki’s attempt cheap, Naina calls her ‘gandh’. Naina even says that Nikki should be ashamed and she should at least leave the mask thinking about her mother. Naina even tells that had the man done such a thing, there would be a huge cry. Nikki says she hid it in her clothes and not Rahul’s and she doesn’t cry playing the ‘woman’ card in the game.


Bigg Boss announces that Nikki is safe and Rahul heads to the red zone. Rahul sarcastically claps and congratulates her.

The Koreaboos, who are avid fans of K-Pop and Manga joined in the session via Zoom and got “tooned” by some of the most celebrated webtoon artists.


The exhibition started with an exciting autograph session with four leading Korean webtoon creators -Jimmy, Myung-hyi Noh, Back Sang-eun and E.HAE.
Jimmy’s, ""Exchanged Hearts"" recorded more than 800 million views through an exclusive contract with Kuaikan, and she held a drawing show and autograph session in Asian countries last year. In addition, ""The Crush of Spring"" of No Myung-hee recorded more than 600 million views, and E.HAE exported her works to various countries, including the U.S., Thailand, and Indonesia. Regarding ‘Back Sang-eun’, her various works have received favourable responses abroad, and recently, ""The Prince of Thorn Castle"" has been renewed and launched as a colour scroll webtoon.

Through this online exhibition site, Rockin'Korea will introduce some 20 Korean webtoons English introduction books as well as a webtoon trailer and drawing videos, etc.

Rockin'Korea along with their partner Kiwa Enterprises, India hope to introduce Korean webtoons in India and spread it not across the world but also believe that it will provide comfort to many people who are feeling low in the pandemic.

The exhibition was planned since early this year, in conjunction with the 2020 ""Hangul Day”. It was originally planned to hold a physical event in India, but due to the pandemic, it got converted into an online exhibition, considering the increase of Covid-19 cases. Marking the 20th anniversary of its establishment, the CEO of Rockin'Korea -Lee Hwa-shin held this exhibition to globalise Korean webtoons this year, after a successful event last year in other countries.


Dr Eunjoo Lim and her husband Sanjib Ghatak, MD of Kiwa Consultants kept the mood of the event light by engaging the youngsters in fun-filled conversation."

"  Nov 4, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ruman Ganguly,Entertainment,Karwa Chauth is about celebrating our bond without fasting: Koel and Nispal,"Thanks to the pandemic, instances of gender role reversal have been on the rise lately. The lockdown saw a more equal sharing of responsibilities in most homes. In such a context, how differently Tollywood’s IT couple – Koel Mallick and Nispal Singh – is looking at celebrating Karwa Chauth this year? “Not just on Karwa Chauth, I pray for the well-being, health and happiness of my partner every day. I believe no work is tailored for a specific gender. So, I try to be a hands-on son, husband and father as well,” says Nispal. He thinks the secret to a successful marriage lies is the ability to take up all kinds of roles and complement your partner. “There have been times when I cooked for the whole family and Koel replaced a bulb. There is no reason why certain things have to be done by me or her. We can equally contribute to everything when needed,” he says.

Talking about their Karwa Chauth plans, he says, “We have been celebrating this occasion with our family and this year is even more special because my son Kabir will be joining us.”

Koel says Karwa Chauth for her and Nispal is about celebrating their bond. “At our place, it’s not just about the wife praying for her husband’s well-being. Once a year is not enough for that, right? For us, it is an occasion to rejoice in the love and understanding that we share throughout the year.”

Talking about the evolving gender roles in her household, Koel says, “We firmly believe in gender equality and follow that in our day-to-day lives. Not many know that Nispal is a great cook and he is more efficient at taking care of the baby than me!”

Karwa Chauth in its traditional form is about the wife observing a fast for the well-being of her husband – his long life, health and happiness. In the Covid situation, will Nispal take a similar pledge this time, we ask. “The idea of wives fasting till the moon comes out is unacceptable to me. We pray for our loved ones every single day,” replies Nispal. Koel, who has never kept a fast on Karwa Chauth, doesn’t endorse the concept either. She says, “This day is about prayers and celebrations, not staying hungry. Like every other day, today too we will be praying for a long and beautiful life with a feeling of togetherness.”"
" Nov 4, 2020, 15:54 IST",Neha Maheshwri,Lifestyle,"Models, talent agency in legal battle over pending dues","Model Arlette Grao has filed a complaint on behalf of 29 models against TFM 360; designer Ashish N Soni, a Director in the agency, has, in turn, filed a defamation case
Recently, a post on the anonymous Instagram handle Diet Sabya, an unofficial watchdog of the fashion industry, said that “the talent agency TFM 360 allegedly owes its models lakhs in unpaid dues” over the last two years. Soon, many of the models mentioned in the post also shared videos about how they are still awaiting their dues.

One of the models, Arlette Grao, who worked with TFM 360 from 2016 to 2018, has now filed a complaint against the agency in Mumbai on behalf of 29 aggrieved parties, including herself. Fashion designer Ashish N Soni, one of the Directors of TFM 360, has been named in the complaint, along with some senior management associates of the company.


In 2018, Arlette had sent TFM 360 a legal notice for non-payment of dues, but Soni, speaking on behalf of the agency, says that she herself was in breach of contract, and was informed of it back in 2018 and sent a show-cause notice, post which the matter was closed.

Soni shares that the agency is working on paying the models, and has already cleared dues of around 70 models out of 120. He adds that he has filed a defamation suit against Arlette and others for dragging his name into the issue and allegedly claiming that he personally owes them money, since he doesn’t own the agency.

Arlette, on the other hand, says that she was forced to take legal action after waiting for two years and finding out about others who were facing a similar issue. She adds that she did not breach any contract with the agency.

Didn’t want to take the legal route, but two years is a long wait for dues: Arlette Grao



Arlette Grao recently filed a complaint against talent agency TFM 360 on behalf of 29 aggrieved parties, including herself, for non-payment of dues. “TFM 360 owes money to more than 29 models. The outstanding amounts range between Rs 5,000 to Rs 30 lakhs. They owe me Rs 3,54,730. In fact, I ended my association with them in 2018 because they never paid on time. I filed a complaint at the Bandra Police Station on October 19, 2020. I took the initiative of filing this complaint and 29 models are listed in it. Three of them even accompanied me to sign the statement as my witnesses. A few among them are foreign nationals whose signatures I haven’t been able to procure,” says Arlette.

Ask her why she waited for two years to file an official complaint and she replies, “I didn’t want to ruin the relationship and just wanted to leave the agency. So, I constantly followed up with them via emails, calls, messages and even shared my plight with directors (of the agency) Rishu Bartaria and Preity Venu. They had convinced me to sign a contract with TFM 360 when I started working with them as a model. I was exclusively bound with them for 18 months from February 1, 2016, to August 2017. That was the only contract I had with them. While I continued working with them even after that, I ended my association with them in August 2018 because of perpetual payment discrepancies and delays. I live alone in Mumbai, have an old parent to take care of and bills to pay. I desperately needed the money they owed me. So, I sent them a legal notice on October 23, 2018. To my surprise, in their reply, they issued a show-cause notice to me, insinuating that I had breached the contract, which wasn’t true unless they were relying on forged documents, because I ended my association with them in August 2018 and completed my notice period. I was thus not liable to pay them any money. They wanted me to pay commission even after I ended my association with them and for work which wasn’t even facilitated by them.”

She further adds, “I wasn’t aware that other models were also facing this issue. It’s only after I left the agency that I learnt about it after meeting the models at auditions and events. I didn’t want to escalate this matter or take it up legally. However, I was forced to do this now because they just don’t want to pay. If they had the intention to pay, two years is a long time. In between, they had sent some emails suggesting that they would clear the dues, but partially, which wasn’t acceptable.”

Some of the other models awaiting their dues say that they were hoping that it will get resolved over time. But after a few shared posts about it on social media, others also joined in. One of the models who has worked with the agency says that lack of work due to the pandemic forced many models to quit the profession, adding that those who were trying to survive this period with no new work decided to bring up the issue online as a last resort to get their pending payments.

We have paid 70 models in the last month, fully intend to pay the rest: Ashish Soni



Fashion designer Ashish N Soni, who is a Director at the talent agency TFM 360, has been named in the complaint filed by Arlette and other models. Soni tells us that TFM 360 was formed in 2015 and he was a promoter with them. “The operating partner was based in Europe, who decided to exit the company in 2018 when the business was running into losses. I wasn’t involved in day-to-day operations even remotely. My job was to promote the business and models. There were investors in the business also. They worked with the company till 2018 and ran the business into losses. I stepped in at that point of time and I covered that loss. So for one and a half years I have been trying to do that,” he explains.

He adds, “Almost 70 models out of 120 have been paid and we intend to pay the rest also. We are in talks with others, every day there are collections and out payments. In this industry payments do not come in on time. There are a lot of dues owed to the company by so many different clients. All those models who are approaching us amicably are being paid. We are trying to help as many
people as possible even at this time of crisis.”

Regarding the social media posts, Soni says, “Sadly, some people have made this a propaganda, they have misused social media. This is just a malicious campaign. Arlette was in breach of contract in 2018 with the company. She had a client that she used to represent and worked with that client directly. In 2018, she had sent us a legal notice, to which our lawyers responded the same year. They sent her a show-cause notice and the matter ended, because she was at fault. Now, two years later, she decides to wake up and readdress the issue. What was she doing for two years? Shouldn’t she have addressed the show-cause notice earlier saying that it was wrong? But instead she took the matter to social media. The judicial system doesn’t exist?”


Soni has also filed a defamation suit in Delhi. “I am dealing with all this legally. Those who have damaged my reputation, I am taking all of them to court. We filed a defamation suit against Arlette and the seven-eight people she has been misleading. The courts will decide what is right and what is wrong.”


The designer says that claims that he has been cheating people out of their dues are “ludicrous.” “In the last two years, almost Rs 2.65 crores have been paid to models. And if there are some who have not been paid, then we should deal with it legally. Please approach the court. How can you pin this on me? Also, I am only one of the Directors in the company, and not an owner as has been claimed by some. I have never taken any money out of this company. I have never taken salary, or any reimbursements. On the contrary, every time there has been a financial loss in the company, I have put in my personal funds. I don’t owe anybody any money. In fact, the company owes me almost Rs 60-70 lakhs.”

"  Nov 4, 2020, 01:00 IST",Anushka.Goel@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,#DIY: Torn clothes? Mend them using sashiko,"Every season, many people end up buying an entire wardrobe’s worth of new clothes, based on the latest fashion, trends and colours. However, as seasons change, so does fashion, leading to cluttered closets full of clothes that are hardly worn. Amid the pandemic, as people embrace sustainability, there is a shift towards buying natural fabrics and reusing clothes for as long as possible. Even fashion designers have started taking back their old designs from customers, in return for vouchers, or are redoing the outfits to extend their wearability.

This sustainability has also lead to a rise in ‘visible mending’ – repairing clothes in a way that the rips and tears look beautiful, through methods such as sashiko – the Japanese art of visible mending. 58-year-old Kate Sekules, who runs a website on visible mending, offers inspiration and instructions, and posts photos of creatively salvaged clothes. “I like the mends to look a little rough,” she says, adding, “If it looks like it came from a factory, it negates the point.”


Explaining it in detail, Sudha Dhingra, a professor in the textile design department at National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), says, “Sashiko is an old technique of reusing old and tattered clothes. The fabrics are also called ‘boro’. Generally, indigo-dyed fabrics are darned with running stitches, using geometric patterns with white thread. In the ’70s, Kenzo and Issey Miyake brought this on the Paris fashion runway, after which it became a part of luxury retail.”


For sashiko, you need sashiko thread, which is twisted more than the normal embroidery thread to prevent it from unravelling. Thread your needle, preferably with white thread, and use a basic running stitch to create patterns on your clothes. The sections you embroider depend upon the final outcome you desire.

"  Nov 4, 2020, 01:00 IST",,Lifestyle,Maintenance sex and its benefits for your sex life,"Having sex just for the sake of having it doesn’t sound too exciting. We may not realise it, but sex has a huge impact on our health and indulging in it, can not only save your relationship but also boost energy and sexual health. Compared to emotional stability, sex is equally important in ensuring that the couple does not experience any bumps in their relationship.
So, to get on with it more smoothly, a couple can indulge in ‘maintenance sex’ to keep the spice and spirit of sex alive.

What is maintenance sex?

It is the act of definitely having sex even when you are bored or sluggish about it. More than many times, you may have wanted to go for the last season of your favourite Netflix show with your partner, but ultimately, ended up having sex. You may have felt bored, but eventually ended up doing it. This especially happens in long-term relationships where people do get bored with having sex, even once in a while. In moments like these, you have to just push yourself a little bit and go for the steamy session with your partner.
Maintenance sex will surely increase your sexual desires and increase your overall stamina. The benefits of having good ol’ sex are endless. Happy oxytocins released from orgasm can be euphoric to your mind and body.

Maintenance sex shouldn’t be the only form of sex you should be having. It’s mostly for people who have been losing out on their sexual life because of work stress or boredom. Sure enough, sex isn’t always necessary but indulging in it once or twice a week should be a goal to be maintained. Extra effort never fails to keep both the partners in check and creatively infusing maintenance sex with some role play, different sex positions or sex toys can only make it more enjoyable.

People need sex. This fact needs to be accepted.

People somehow think that one should only have sex when they are in the mood. Both partners need to have mutual feelings and arousal to have sex. Well, this is completely false. One partner maybe in the mood and the other may not feel like having sex; this leaves the other partner embarrassed and ashamed for wanting sex. This is how similar situations escalate to sexless relationships or marriages.


Both partners need to compromise on their preferences for the sake of the relationship and its longevity. This is where maintenance sex comes to play. Imagine that it’s a task that you have been dreading to do, but finally, when you did it, the result felt amazing and all things nice.


Sex is all about intimacy

To maintain a healthy sexual relationship, firstly, both partners need to be there for each other. Emotionally and physically. Both have to be willing in order to indulge in sexual activities, like maintenance sex. However, if maintenance sex is the only way you are doing it, then there is a different underlying problem that needs to be identified and worked on. Other than that, if your efforts count, then you are good to go.


After all, sex is about love, happiness, security and most importantly, the willingness to be there and do things for each other, even if you don’t want to."
"  Nov 4, 2020, 01:00 IST",Riya Sharma,TV,Gautam Rode and Pankhuri Awasthy: It’ll be the third year we fast together on Karwa Chauth,"Karwa Chauth is special for Gautam Rode and Pankhuri Awasthy, who have been fasting together on the day since they got married. “It is going to be our third year fasting together,” says Pankhuri, as Gautam jumps in, “ Shaadi se pehle bhi rakha tha!” “No, I kept it. You did not,” chides Pankhuri. This year, she tells us, “I asked him ‘Karwa Chauth aa raha hai, tum rakhoge? And he was like, ‘Of course, yeh koi poochne ki baat hai?’”

The couple starts to prepare for Karwa Chauth a day before. While this year they may not be able to go out, the couple does have a routine they follow. Pankhuri says, “I like to put mehendi a day before Karwa Chauth. He hogs till 12 in the night. Imagine, he also eats sargi in the morning!” Gautam, on the other hand, spends most of the day sleeping. “ Kabhi sar mein dard ho raha hota hai, kabhi pet mein. I sleep after eating sargi and wake up around 4pm. Then I watch TV and sleep again. Pankhuri doesn’t drink water that often in any case, and I always have a water bottle with me. So, fasting’s tough for me,” says Gautam.


And what’s the best thing about keeping the fast as a couple, we ask? “I think it’s the fact that you keep it together. It’s special that you are doing something for your partner,” Pankhuri says, as Gautam adds, “I think it’s inhumane that your partner is fasting while you are hogging, so that’s why I fast.”


And what about when they are working on Karwa Chauth? “Last year, I was shooting in Varanasi and he came there on the day of the festival,” Pankhuri tells us, while Gautam chimes in, “I flew there bhookha pyaasa. Cheating kar sakta tha airplane mein, but maine nahi ki!”


The lockdown gave people a chance to spend ample time with their loved ones, and Gautam and Pankhuri are no different. Pankhuri shares, “The world came to a halt, and there were so many things we did together, from jhaadu-pochchha to watching shows. I also learnt how to cook. There was a phase when I tried to learn painting and also another language. We also fought, but nothing major.” “Time seekhne sikhaane mein hi chala gaya,” adds Gautam, who also tried his hand at TikTok. “ Socho, main pehli baar TikTok par aaya aur TikTok hi ban ho gaya!” laughs Gautam."

She has already wrapped up her Tamil film, and had been shooting for Haseen Dilruba before heading out to Dubai for a tiny break between projects. Due to her packed date diary for the next few months, the actress may just get a day or two off during the festive season. She’s expected to start shooting for two films in November. But it’s not all work for the Thappad actress, who has managed to furnish her new apartment just in time for Diwali. Talking about it, she shares, “I had bought a house last year, this one is right above the flat that I live in. It will be ready by Diwali. That is the new addition to my life, which we will celebrate. My parents are already here. In fact, they watched over the work for the house while I was away shooting for my film. Around Diwali, it would be functional, but before that, all of us will offer prayers together, so that the house exudes positivity and happiness.”

Usually, she sets aside certain important dates so that she can spend time with her family during festivals like Diwali. “This year will be very different from any other,” she says, adding, “However, I am not regretting it. I didn’t work for almost five months, and that has created a lot of backlog. Rashmi Rocket and Loop Lapeta will be shot in alternate schedules between November and February 2021. So, I don’t think I will get a break between these films. It will be a working Diwali.”"

In this column, celebrities reminisce about catching their fave films at theatres and the magic of the movie hall...

Our family used to go to theatres only once in a while, and that too when a big film came out. The first film I remember watching is Kadhalan at Devi. I didn’t understand the film much at that age, but I remember enjoying Prabhu Deva’s dance moves. I embarrassed my parents while watching Thenali. I laughed so much that I kept hitting the front seat. The people in those seats turned around and shouted at my parents.


I remember bunking special classes to watch Anniyan in Sathyam Cinemas. The next day, we were all asked to come to the principal’s office. I also managed to watch the A-certified Manmadhan in the theatre even though I was under 18! And later, when I watched Paruthiveeran, my entire perspective about cinema changed. I developed a huge respect for cinema as an art.

Over time, I began watching films with more enthusiasm. I used to search for good films and watch them. I have two big memories of watching films in the theatre. One is a sad one — I did a minor role in a big-budget film. I went around town and announced that I was doing a role in the film. I was so excited, but as I watched the film in Devi theatre, I realised that they had chopped all my scenes. I didn’t know that there was a process like this and that you might not be seen in the film. It was a humiliating experience as my friends thought I was lying.


But I also had my aha moment when I watched Soodhu Kavvum. The film has dark humour and I was worried if audiences would get it. In the preview show, nobody laughed. But when it released, the audiences laughed like crazy. And at a screening of Kootathil Oruvan in the theatre, I saw a boy who looked exactly like my character in the film, who had come all alone, and cried during an emotional scene. All such experiences can be witnessed only in the theatre. Heading to the theatre has become a habit of sorts, now. These past few months proved to be difficult for me. I recently watched Ford Vs Ferrari on TV and felt sad about missing such a great film in the theatre. Going to the theatre brings so much joy. The experience of shouting, clapping, and throwing confetti at the screen while watching our favourite star is incredible fun."

Rakshit, who is currently enjoying a break back home in Udupi, tells us, ""My current line-up of films includes 777 Charlie that is in the final leg of shooting. We're headed to capture the snow-capped mountains in North India for this sequence. Then, we will begin work on Hemanth M Rao's Sapta Sagaradaache Yello. The toss is then between the Kirik Party sequel, Punyakoti and Richie. I have my heart set on Punyakoti, but the team feels that it might be better to get the Kirik Party sequel on the road first.”

According to sources, when the lockdown came into effect, there was about 30-days of shoot pending on 777 Charlie, which the team is now in the process of completing. After a stint in Kodaikanal, director Kiranraj K is currently on location recce in Kashmir.

They will get married on Valentine's Day in 2021. The couple had earlier told Bangalore Times that they were set to wed this year, but the pandemic delayed those plans. Now, Krishna reveals, ""The wedding and reception will be in Bengaluru, on February 14, while we will have an event the day before."" The couple had a special shoot just for the announcement.

Krishna lets us in on their love story. He says, ""I had first contacted Milana when I was looking at casting for Madarangi. We had seen her pictures and wanted to cast her. We had even met her, but she rejected the role. We met after that on the set of Nam Duniya Nam Style. We became friends who exchanged pleasantries. Following this we worked together in Charlie. For almost 90% of the shoot there, we were just friends.""


So, what changed then? ""Towards the end of the shoot, I wanted to settle down properly in my personal life. I was in pretty much in the mental space of Aadi after his relationship with Jo in Love Mocktail, so I wanted to get married and settle down. On a February 14, I proposed marriage to her and she said, 'Why not?' I’d say we fell in love thereafter, as we got to know each other better. It's a different love story, unlike the love at first sight ones. In a way, it is just like in Love Mocktail. We tried to capture that essence in the film.""

The couple is hoping to have a wedding ceremony that will have all their loved ones in attendance. ""Since there is a decline in the Covid cases now, we hope we can invite all who we want to and celebrate it like we wanted to,"" says Krishna.


Was the Valentine's Day wedding plan always on the cards? ""We had initially thought of a summer wedding in either April or May. But when we checked for auspicious dates, the first that came up was February 14. The next was March 25 and then no other dates till October. February 14 seemed nice and we went ahead with it. I always wanted Valentine's Day to be special and what better way than to have a wedding on that day,"" says Krishna."

And it is only now that she has taken baby steps as an individual artiste, with her first-ever single. Called Naa Haaduve Nimagagiye, the song, she says, is an ode to Karnataka, its people and language. “The lockdown was the first time in many years that I could sit back and think about the things that I want to do as a singer. I’ve had a few ideas for a while, but never had the time. I asked composer-cinematographer Giridhar Divan, who I have collaborated with earlier, if he could compose a melody for me to the lyrics written by Hari Paraak. I wanted it to be a song that we could release around Karnataka Rajyotsava, as a tribute to the many years of love that I have received from the people here. It is not an upbeat Huttidare… kind of song, but captures the love for the motherland melodiously. The song has come out beautifully, including a video that we shot in locations across Udupi, Kalasa, etc,” says Anuradha, adding that singer-composer Nakul Abhayankar programmed the song.

Naa Haaduve Nimagagiye will be out today and now that she has forayed into this space, will there be more music from Anuradha? “It will largely depend on the response to my debut single. But yes, I do have some ideas to work on,” she says."
"  Nov 5, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,This is the best food to fight inflammation,"There are two types of inflammation, one acts as a defence mechanism of the body, while the other is the slow one that continues working in the background. The latter type of inflammation is bad for the body and is called chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation over time can take a toll on your health.
Chronic inflammation can up your risk of developing serious diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disease, depression, arthritis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

Chronic inflammation has no visible symptoms and thus is hard to be detected. But there is no harm in being proactive and simply eating a diet that reduces inflammation.
Here is the best food that can reduce chronic inflammation in the body.

Best food to reduce inflammation

As per experts, omega 3 does wonders in reducing inflammation. Eating foods rich in omega 3 like salmon and other oily fatty fish is your best bet to combat chronic inflammation.

The EPS and DHA in omega 3 play a role in preventing pro-inflammatory compounds and inflammatory processes and encourages the production of anti-inflammatory compounds.

Studies have shown that taking omega 3 supplements help combat inflammation related to conditions to rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's lupus, type 1 diabetes, asthma, psoriasis, heart disease and more.

Various other researchers have shown that taking omega 3 supplements for four months lowered the inflammation in middle-aged and older adults.

Not just foods rich in omega 3, there are 3 other foods that can help combat inflammation. These include leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables and berries. Including leafy greens in your daily diet and having berries several times a week can also help.

Having leafy green vegetables regularly can lower the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancers and brain deterioration. Add 6 cups of different green vegetables like lettuce, spinach, kale etc in your weekly diet.

According to a study, people who ate 2 cups of cruciferous vegetables a day for two weeks, saw an improvement in inflammatory markers.

Aim for at least 5 servings of vegetables like broccoli, sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, bok choy, arugula and radish

Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, cranberries and blackberries are packed with antioxidants and anthocyanins, which fight the free radical that promote inflammation. Aim for having at least two cups of berries per week.


Foods that increase inflammation

Now that you know the foods that you should eat to reduce inflammation, you must also know the foods that you should avoid.


Foods low in fibre, refined carbs, added sugars and artificial sweeteners, fried foods, high-fat, trans fat, saturated fat and processed meats should be avoided.


Too much alcohol and caffeine can also increase inflammation. So avoid these foods and make sure to add omega 3, leafy greens, berries, cruciferous veggies in your daily diet to reduce inflammation."

Called 2020, the film will have Komal pairing with Dhanya Balakrishnan (of Sarvajanikarige Suvarnaavakaasha fame).

Komal says, “After Kempegowda 2, I a lot of offers for comedy films, but nothing excited me. I know that I have to be selective about the subjects I work on, because audiences today are exposed to quality content on digital platforms. This film has a fun subject set in the backdrop of the pandemic. In fact, when Rajashekar gave me a narration, I must have laughed from start to finish and I was hooked. The film will explore how the world was not prepared to tackle the crisis and how one family tries to stay safe during the pandemic. My character’s attempts to ensure his family’s safety form the crux of the narrative.”


Director Rajashekar adds, “I wrote this film during the lockdown. It is a subject that everyone will be able to relate to, as we have all faced various ordeals during that time. We are looking at going on floors by the end of November. While Dhanya is one of the female leads, we are on the lookout for two more heroines in the film, which will also have Tabla Nani, Apoorva and Kuri Prathap in prominent roles. ”"

And with the city weather pretty pleasing with intermittent rain, many find it a perfect time to go for road trips.

I had also put up this status on Whatsapp. I started getting so many messages and calls from people asking about my well-being.""

Pavitra has been upset with Eijaz saving Jasmin from the nomination and vents out her frustration in the episode.

She also elbows him and screams her lungs out in a verbal spat. While Pavitra accuses him of betrayal, the latter justifies saying he is the captain and he can take whosoever’s name he wants.


After a heated conversation, Pavitra fumes in anger and refers Eijaz’ attitude and aggression to Bigg Boss 13 winner Sidharth Shukla. She says, “Sidharth ne sikhaya hai isko. Sidharth galeech, lichar aur ehsaan farmosh nahi tha. You won’t be able to be like him till your next birth. First play for yourself and show your existence. What are you trying to show by copying others?”

Jasmin comes to talk to Eijaz and asks him why is Pavitra talking about ‘betrayal’. Eijaz says, ‘I have been fair and I have really felt that you were deserving. I had asked you earlier if I can do anything for you, you had said no. Hence, when I got a chance to do something for you, I did it. If anyone has problem with that, I don’t care.”


Jasmin tries a lot to calm them down, but later walks out saying all this drama is for content.

" Nov 5, 2020, 00:26 IST",,Entertainment,NCB quizzes Deepika Padukone's ex-manager Karishma Prakash in drugs case,"The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Wednesday questioned actress Deepika Padukone's former manager Karishma Prakash in connection with a drugs case linked to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput.
The development comes a day after she was asked by a Mumbai court to appear before the NCB. Prakash had applied for anticipatory bail on Sunday, after which the special court gave her interim relief from arrest till November 7.

Prakash had been untraceable after the drug enforcement agency summoned her for questioning as it found some hashish and CBD oil from her premises during the raids conducted last month.
According to NCB sources, Prakash appeared before the NCB earlier in the day and was questioned about her whereabouts when she went untraceable and was also asked about the reason of the CBD oil and hashish found at her home.

The sources further said that NCB also asked her about the names of the drug peddlers who were found to be linked with her.

Earlier in the day, Vijay Subramaniam, co-founder and CEO of KWAN, in a statement said, ""Prakash tendered her resignation on October 21 with immediate effect and it was accepted.""

He said that Prakash now has ""nothing"" to do with KWAN or with any of the artists that the agency represents, including Deepika.

""The ongoing investigations are on Prakash as an individual. We would request media houses and reporters to incorporate this fact while reporting on this issue,"" he said.

The NCB had earlier recorded the statement of Prakash in September. The NCB also quizzed Deepika, and actresses Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan in connection with a drugs case in the Sushant death probe.


The NCB has also seized the phones of the three actresses and sent them to the forensic department. It also recorded the statement of actress Rakulpreet Singh.


The drug enforcement agency had registered a case on the request of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after some alleged chats discussing drugs came to fore in August.


Sushant was found dead in his flat on June 14. Besides NCB, the CBI and ED are also probing the death of the actor."

" Nov 5, 2020, 00:26 IST",,Lifestyle,Know what your sex moves tell about you and your partner,"Sex positions have got to be one of the most creative, exciting and euphoric things to be ever created. Several positions in the book, whether it’s unconventional or the same old ones, get couples excited for some action. After all, who doesn’t want to sweat in the bedroom?
Sex is all about connection. People say the greater the connection, the more exotic sex is. That’s definitely true as sex, being exciting in itself, needs variations from time to time. It’s to keep the fire alive. Role-playing, sex toys, venturing into multiples partners and more, have become so popular that nowadays, people have started to accept and explore more of their sexuality. But nothing excites a couple more than different sex positions. This is an all-time favourite.

Additionally, it’s true when people say that one’s preference for a certain sex position speaks a lot about their personality. Researchers have suggested that people often go for wild sex moves to come out of one’s introverted shell and mingle freely among other peers. Hence, we bring to you a few sex positions and their corresponding personalities.
1. Missionary

People who prefer this position want intimacy from their partner. These women love to look into their partner’s eyes while men love this dominating position along with kissing their partner. However, if couples always prefer this position, then they are more likely to be afraid of experimenting with new things. They cower away from challenging situations as well.

2. Doggy-style

If you both prefer this style then, it’s more about tending to your sexual needs than any emotional connection. This position brings out the animalistic instinct in you as this is one of the most pleasurable sex positions. Both men and women have a high chance of getting an orgasm. This also means that you’re not afraid to accept your wild side and that you’re up for any spontaneous things.

3. Cowgirl

Women love this position the most. They are on top and feel dominant while having sex. This sex position also allows them to be sexually stimulated the most, by directing moves and thrusts according to her own pleasure. Men love to lie back and look at their partner in action while also enjoying their view. This also means that the individuals are independent of their preferences and don’t believe in pressuring the other for their wants.


4. Spooning


This is not cuddling if you’re thinking that. In this sex position, the woman becomes the smaller spoon while the man positions himself behind her. This move is very intimate and caring. Couples prefer to do this when they are more interested in each other’s emotional needs than sexual ones. In this case, the couples are usually soft-hearted and affectionate.


5. Reverse cowgirl


This position is favoured by those who prefer to keep a no-strings-attached relationship or occasionally want to focus on just pleasuring themselves. The woman on top turns her knack towards her partner and tries to focus on her stimulation points. The man, on the other hand, favours this position more often as well. This sex move also suggests that the couple prefer to keep their viewpoints straight and not indulge in frivolous things."
"  Nov 5, 2020, 01:00 IST",Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Television celebs who kept themselves busy with music videos through the pandemic,"Shooting of films and TV shows are limping back to normal, however, there is one trend that caught on during the lockdown and it continues to thrive even after it’s been lifted — that is music videos starring popular names of television. The past few months have witnessed a surge in singles released by singers and music companies, which are then shot with TV stars. This has created a win-win situation for denizens of both the industries, music and TV.
Music videos are creative and less time-consuming: TV actors
For all practical purposes, it makes economic sense for the makers to rope in a glamourous TV actor for a song, rather than a movie star. However, television stars are also household names, so when music producers feature them in their music videos, it becomes a casting coup for the audiences. One such case is the music video of 'Humko Tum Mil Gaye', which featured 'Naagin' 5 co-actors, Dheeraj Dhoopar and Hina Khan.

The actors, too, seem to gain from these music videos as it not only adds to their popularity, but it also gives them a chance to do something creative. Dheeraj says, “I have done around three music videos, because I found the concept appealing. I wanted to try something different.” Shivin Narang, who featured in the video 'Sunn Zara' with Tejasswi Prakash recently, adds, “A music video offers opportunities to earn our livelihood during a temporary phase like this. Besides, it is easier to shoot for a music video than a TV show or a film, during the pandemic.”

Actor Arjun Bijlani thinks differently. He says, “Music video or a TV show, one has to be careful while stepping out. I did the music video of 'Ishq Tanha' with Reem Shaikh, because I liked the concept. It is a break-up melody and people love to hear such emotional songs during the pandemic. Also, shooting a music video is less time-consuming.”

Actors need to keep working to maintain brand recall: Paras Chhabra

Interestingly, the trend of TV actors featuring in music videos seemed to have kickstarted with 'Bigg Boss 13’s contestants — Sidharth Shukla-Shehnaaz Gill, Asim Riaz-Himanshi Khurana and Paras Chhabra-Mahira Sharma during the lockdown. Paras says, “In our industry, out of sight means out of mind. Actors need to keep working to maintain their brand recall. Having said that, we did not jump into it just because it is a lucrative offer, the song has to be creatively satisfying, too.” Mahira adds, “It is definitely an interesting way to branch out and entertain the masses. We shot the video from our homes, but you can still see the chemistry between us.”Asim Riaz did four music videos with special friend Himanshi Khurana. Shefali Jariwala, too, teamed up with singer Mika Singh for a remake of a hit song of the nineties.


Other TV actors who starred in music videos include Erica Fernandes; she shot for a song after her show 'Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2' wrapped up. She features in a single with 'Bepannah' actor Harshad Chopda in Goa, the teaser of which released recently. Shaheer Sheikh also shot for a single 'Ae Mere Dil' with Tejasswi Prakash after his show 'Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyaar Ke' got over. Hiten Tejwani, Zain Imam, Shakti Arora, Namit Khanna, Sara Khan, Shama Sikander and Vishal Singh came together for a music video 'Ek Umeed' dedicated to frontline workers in the COVID-19 battle.


So, while many found themselves grounded in a work-from-home routine during the lockdown and in the following months, TV stars were busy shooting for songs from their homes, or in locations like Goa and Lonavala. “Music videos kept us busy and the masses entertained,” sums up Shivin, adding, “It also kept us positive as we did something creative during this difficult period.”"

The wedding festivities will be a three-day affair starting with the mehndi function on November 29, followed by a temple wedding on December 1 and a reception on December 2 at a five-star in Mumbai.
In an exclusive chat with BT, Aditya revealed, “Shweta and I are extremely excited to finally get married after being in a relationship for 10 years. Due to the pandemic, the wedding will only include family and close friends. We are planning to have a sangeet function on the day of the reception, which will include performances by the entire family. Our wedding outfits are designed by Shweta because along with being an actress, she is also a fashion designer. For many years now, she has been designing my outfits.”
Talking about Shweta, who has acted opposite him in his debut film 'Shaapit', Aditya shared, “Shweta is an extremely calm and polite girl. I am just the opposite, highly energetic and sometimes impatient, too. But, she has been extremely patient, and I can say she is the balancing factor in my life.”


While the wedding is still being planned, it seems Aditya has the playlist ready. “Shweta and I will dance to my father’s song 'Pehla Nasha' from 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar' because, for me, it was love at first sight when I met her. I recently bought a new apartment, and I am excited that Shweta and I will start our new life in the new house.”

A few days ago, the couple went on a short holiday to a retreat near Lonavala. Aditya planned the romantic getaway to propose to Shweta officially. He said, “Maldives was my first choice. I had planned to propose to her at the exotic beach destination in March 2020 and I had kept the ring ready since December 2019. Our flights were booked in March, but eight hours before our departure, we got the news that Maldives was under lockdown. So, I could not officially get engaged then. When we went to Lonavala, I surprised her by popping the question and slipping the ring on her finger.”


The two plan to go for their honeymoon to Gulmarg, Kashmir. He said, “Shweta loves skiing and I felt it would be ideal to go to Gulmarg in the winters. If everything goes well, we plan to go there.”


Aditya also dismissed rumours around his father Udit Narayan’s recent comment, where he said that his son should be doubly sure before getting married. Aditya explained, “My father was just kidding when he said that I should be doubly sure. Obviously, if you are getting married, it is a responsibility that you are accepting, and he felt that I should be ready for it. People blew the entire comment out of proportion. I am the only son and my parents couldn’t have been happier that their son is getting married.”"
"  Nov 5, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,Jyoti Sharma: The difficult phase two years ago taught me to be strong,"Jyoti Sharma, who became a household name as Tejaswini in 'Aisi Deewangi Dekhi Nahi Kahi' ('ADDNK'), returned to the fiction genre after two years with 'Ram Pyaare Sirf Humare'. She was in the news for speaking about the alleged ill-treatment on the set of 'ADDNK'. In January 2018, Bombay Times had reported about Jyoti and her co-star Pranav Misshra quitting the show after alleged harassment meted out by the producers. A month later, the show went off air abruptly. Ask her if the incident left her bitter and she says, “Everything has been resolved amicably. The phase taught me to be strong and speak my mind. I don’t wish to divulge details of the matter, as it’s in the past. I consciously took a break from work, as I wanted to spend time with my family. I barely got to be with my parents ever since I started shooting for 'ADDNK'. I lost my mother four years ago and the show launched just six months after that. All I wanted to do once the daily soap ended was to be with my family. That void was difficult to fill, but my father and sister gave me strength to deal with it. My mother was my best friend. We would talk to each other 10-15 times a day. Though she is gone, I still feel her around me. She is my guiding light.”

On the work front, Jyoti plays a doting yet over possessive wife on the new show. Is she a possessive partner in real life as well? “It may seem difficult to believe, but I am single. In fact, I have never been in a relationship. I was always focused on my work. When I was in school, all I wanted to do was learn and teach dance, which is exactly what I did. I came to Mumbai when I turned 16. So, I never really got time to invest in a relationship. Now, my father wants me to find a partner and keeps asking me about it (laughs!),” she replies, adding, “I can relate to my character, Dulari. If someone shows extra interest in your partner, you will feel insecure. However, I am quite secure as a person. When in a relationship, I will trust my partner to not betray me.”"

"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Will the Apex Court decide Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani's fates?,"Police cracking down on drug mafia is nothing new. But this year, the investigation took on a new direction, when it was alleged that several high-profile members of the Kannada TV and film industries were also involved in the procurement and distribution of banned narcotic substances. Many popular names were grilled for hours together for their alleged ties to people believed to be involved in the trade, as well as in party circuits were drugs were distributed. The shocker, of course, was the arrest of two popular Kannada actresses – Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa – who have been in judicial custody for two months now, as the investigation proceeds. After their bail applications were dismissed by the NDPS Special Court, forcing them to move the Karnataka High Court, the actresses got no relief there either.
Here is a look at how the investigation, which has been dubbed the Sandalwood drug scandal, has played out so far and what lies ahead for the two actresses…


August 27
Reports emerge quoting the Narcotics Control Bureau that prominent names from the Kannada film industry, including actors and music directors, are involved in drug consumption, following a string of raids and arrest of three peddlers on August 21.



August 28/29

Filmmaker Indrajit Lankesh turns ‘whistleblower’; claims there is a section of the Kannada film industry that indulges in substance abuse. He is summoned by the Central Crime Branch Bengaluru for interrogation and to substantiate his claims.



September 3

Actress Ragini Dwivedi is issued summons for an inquiry following, the arrest of an associate of hers. She fails to show up, but sends out a statement that she would co-operate with the CCB.



September 4

Ragini Dwivedi is arrested following an early morning raid at her residence and a day-long interrogation by the CCB. She is taken into CCB custody.



September 8

After many denials about her involvement in this case despite a close associate of hers being arrested, actress Sanjjanaa Galrani is arrested and taken into CCB custody after a raid at her residence and interrogation at the CCB office.



September 14

Ragini Dwivedi is sentenced to judicial custody and moved to the central jail at Parappana Agrahara, after medical tests for samples to be sent to the Forensic Science Lab.



September 16

Sanjjanaa Galrani is sent to judicial custody at the central jail at Parappana Agrahara. She too is taken for tests to collect samples to be sent to the Forensic Science Lab.



September 28

The NDPS Special Court rejects bail applications of both actresses citing that the investigation was still in preliminary stages and that they could tamper with evidence if allowed out.



November 3

The Karnataka High Court dismisses their bail applications.



What lies ahead...

Legal experts say that Ragini and Sanjjanaa can now move the Supreme Court for bail. However, such proceedings, if initiated, is time consuming, meaning that they will have to remain in jail as under trials for at least another fortnight. Their future legal moves will also depend on the charge-sheet filed by the CCB.




The charges


As per the suo motu case registered by CCB officials at the Cottonpet police station, the actresses have been booked under various sections of the NDPS Act - Sections 21, 21 C, 27 A, 27 B and 29. The actresses, who are both popular names in Bengaluru's party circuit, have been accused of being a part of selling, procuring and distributing banned drugs and being in touch with drug peddlers."
"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Lifestyle,Ludo and Snakes & Ladders get a twist in these board games,"The popularity of addictive mobile games such as Ludo and Snakes & Ladders has burgeoned thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and the increase in screen time. Chennai-based conscious jewellery designer Gina Joseph, however, decided to take this idea and turn it on its head, by giving these games a traditional spin.
The craft revivalist recentlydesigned and launched traditional board versions of three popular games — Ludo, Snakes & Ladders, and Bagh-Chal (a popular two-player board game). The surprising Indian origins behind all these three games drew Gina to design these games and take a trip down history lane. “While the first traces of Ludo or Chausar can be found in the 3rd Century BC, many historians claim games of Snakes & Ladders or Moksha Patam were played as early as the 2nd Century BC,” begins Gina.

The games were a product of the lockdown, which has arguably been the hardest on artisans. “The past six-seven months have been crazy for us. It was just a complete slump. I have not been able to give my artisans any work. We came out with this during the lockdown, where we wanted to see if we could make a product that could weave itself into the lives of people at this scenario,” recalls Gina.
And this is when she found that a sizable number of population was going back to the culture of playing board games, thanks to the emphasis on indoor time. “Even though most of them preferred digital games, I thought why not use the same craft tradition and design traditional board games. The more I read about it, the more exciting it sounded,” she notes.

Handcrafted by the artisans of Puri, and Odisha, these board games are made out of palm leaf Pattachitra (palm leaf etching) artwork.

The games are filled with traditional motifs, right from the etched wooden box that it comes with. “A lot of work has gone into it. At the same time, it does not deviate from the artisan’s craft,” Gina notes, adding that the pieces are completely sustainable. Shells replace plastic player pieces, while palm leaves replace plastic boards. The games were a result of countless Zoom calls and brainstorming sessions with the artisans, she adds.

“This was my first time working with these artisans remotely. Around 4-5 artisans worked on these pieces and all the pressure was not on one person. That way, everyone got work as well. That is one of the main reasons why we are doing what we are doing,” she notes.


The idea of such initiatives is to bring people together and inculcate curiosity about traditional crafts, Gina observes. “Even when I make jewellery, most people are clueless about the material. A lot of them do not know that a few crafts exist. Many do not know about these crafts and their origins. Interestingly, kids who see our craft pieces ask parents about why they are not learning these things in school,” she smiles, adding that it was important to impart craft education.


With Generation Z waking up to the board game culture this pandemic, it would be interesting to see them respect the different kinds of handicrafts in the country, Gina notes. “This is a traditional product, which is very much made for the modern consumer,” she says.


The hope is for youngsters to leave their mobile games behind and sit with their family and have conversations while playing board games,” she adds"
"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Imman’s long-term wish is to do a period film or a musical,"Yesterday saw the 10th anniversary of Mynaa, a trendsetting film that provided big breaks for almost every major technician and actors who worked on it — director Prabu Solomon, actors Amala Paul and Vidaarth, cinematographer M Sukumar and composer D Imman.


The affable composer, who has become one of the most sought-after music directors in Kollywood today, has now joined the exclusive list of composers who have worked on a Superstar Rajinikanth film, with Annaatthe.


Given that Mynaa saw him reinventing himself, ask Imman what plans he has for the next 10 years, and he says, “Frankly, I never looked at it this way. That is why I don’t have the mindset that I should change gears now because 10 years have passed. It is the films that actually chart your course. You take on a new avatar for the sake of that film, and that sets the tone. You can never intentionally do that. Something about the film will excite you and bring about that change in you, and shape your future self as an artiste. Ultimately, we are composing music for a film, so it is only natural that the film dictates this change.”

But he does have a wishlist when it comes to the type of projects he would like to be part of. “My long-term wish is to do a period film or an entirely musical script, the kind that we used to get earlier... like Sindhu Bairavi or Sankarabharanam. I’d say the last film that came in this space was Sangamam. So, I am looking out for such projects, and perhaps, such a project might bring forth a new dimension of myself,” he says."

Dhanya Ramkumar - Kasturi Nivasa
This film holds a special spot in my heart simply because it explores human emotions in a way I haven't seen or experienced in any other film so far. The way my grandfather has portrayed his character, the way the director has brought out the story - all of it just adds to the character of the film. When I walked in to watch the film in a theatre I was a different person and when I walked out, I was a different person.


Dheeren Ramkumarr - Gandhada Gudi
This is one of my favourites as it speaks about the environment, nature and wildlife conservation. It touches upon the issue of poachers and sandalwood smuggling as well. He played a forest range officer and Vishnuvardhan sir was also in the film. The story created awareness about forest conservation. This movie definitely inspired me a lot."
"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sindhu Vijayakumar,Lifestyle,Spring cleaning tips for Deepavali,"Deepavali is synonymous with spring cleaning. Although this tidying-up exercise may not really excite you, the prospect of a shiny house is quite a motivation. With a bit of planning and preparation, maybe you will even look forward to this task. We tell you how ...
Have a schedule
Don’t start cleaning randomly. Instead, plan a schedule. It would be good if you keep at least two days for the cleaning work. Keep your cleaning tools handy. It would save time if you start from the ceiling and finish it off with floor cleaning.


De-clutter first The first step should be to do de-clutter and dispose of all unwanted stuff. From makeup products to clothes, footwear, and utensils, segregate the unwanted items and get rid of them.

Start cleaning from the ceiling, followed by fans. Ceiling fans catch a lot of soot and while cleaning, this dirt may fall on the furniture. To avoid this, use an old pillow cover. Open the pillowcase and wipe the fan blades so that the dust falls inside the pillow cover and not on the floor or furniture. Window sills and grills, too, tend to accumulate a lot of dust. You can wipe them off using a cloth and use an old toothbrush to remove the dust accumulated in the cervices. Do not forget to wipe the doors, too.

One has to be careful while cleaning the lamps. Unplug the lamp before you start cleaning them. Use a soft cloth and warm water to wipe off the glass parts in the lamp.

Television and laptop
If you use a dirty cloth to clean the LCD screen, it will result in scratches. Use a damp soft cotton cloth with fabric softener to clean your TV screen. To clean glass tables, mirrors and windows, use the glass cleaning liquids that are available in the market. If you want to use a home-made one, mix one part of fabric softener with four parts of water. Mix well and spray on the glass or cloth to clean them. While cleaning home appliances, remove the dirt first using a duster cloth. Then, clean them using a clean and dry cloth. Use the cleanser and then scrub using a clean cloth to avoid scratches.

You can use the baby wipes or paper towels to clean the computer or laptop. The sticky notes are quite useful to clean the dirt that builds up between the keys of the keyboard. This way, you can clean your keyboard without damaging the parts. Use a soft face towel to clean the LCD screen.

Wardrobes, curtains and beds
Before cleaning the wardrobe, ensure that you have separated all the old and unwanted clothes from the good ones. You can donate clothes that are in good condition to NGOs or underprivileged people. Take out all the clothes and fold them properly. Remove liners or papers if any on the racks and replace them with good/new ones. Instead of stashing all the clothes in one cabin, arrange them properly in different racks.

Remove the curtains, sofa covers and bedspreads, and wash them in a washing machine or dry clean them depending on the washing instructions and material. Dust the cot and wipe it with a soft cloth. If possible, spread the bed and pillows in sunlight so that they become germ-free.

Kitchen cleaning
Cleaning the kitchen is not as tough as you think. Most of the kitchen cleaning can be done using dishwashing soap, vinegar, warm water and baking soda. Start by cleaning the racks and boxes inside the kitchen, followed by kitchenware, dishes, and bowls. You can use a detergent to clean the wall tile. Using warm water and detergent, you can clean cabinets, exhaust fans and floors.

DIY cleansers
To make a cleanser for tiles and tabletops, mix equal parts of vinegar and soap water.
To clean exhaust fans and floor, use warm water and detergent.
Mix one part of fabric softener with four-parts of water and spray to clean glass tables, mirrors and tabletops.

Cleaning tools that you should keep ready
1. Broom
2.House ladder
3.Cleansers
4. Duster
5. Glassware cleaner

6. Vacuum cleaner

7.Cotton cloth

8.Warm water

9. Baking soda

"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,"#TheatreLove: OTT will never be a threat to theatres, Shakti Soundar Rajan","When I think of great movie experiences I had as a child, two films that I still cherish are Thevar Magan and Baashha. I remember both the movies taking me to a completely different world. I watched the former from RP theatre in Dindigul and the latter from Maris in Trichy. I hail from Pachalur, a small hill station. The nearest theatre used to be in Dindigul — I loved travelling for about an hour to Dindigul to watch movies at an age when one was usually not expected to go to films alone.


My father used to work in Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and films used to be screened there at an auditorium every Saturday. I had my first film-watching experience there. When I watched Anjali, I was eight years old. Years later, watching Ghilli at KG Cinemas was one-of-a-kind experience. Be it Deepavali or Pongal, every festival for me used to be about movies.


Watching FDFS of every top hero film has always been a fantastic experience, and I cherish each of them. Since the government has permitted theatres to function now, and I think it’s just a matter of time for the audience to return. Watching films in a theatre surrounded by people is a communal feeling – enjoying a dramatic action has been something human beings have been doing to since a few centuries. We had stage performances earlier, which were replaced by the current theatres. It is something like food and water for us. OTT will never be a threat to theatres. In fact, like satellite, OTT will be additional revenue for movies. Movie halls, along with such online movie watching platforms, will continue to co-exist."
"  Nov 6, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,"Seven types of rest we need, as per a therapist","Resting is as important for the body as eating right and exercising. When we talk about rest, we mostly think about physical and mental rest. But that's not true. Don't be surprised when we tell you there are many more types of rest we need from time to time. In an interesting post on Instagram by Tasha Bailey, a trauma counsellor and therapist, here is a list of seven types of rest we all need.
Her post read


The pandemic and work from home demand us to be switched on and available all the time. Being available all the time can eventually lead to burn out if one does not take proper rest and breaks.
Here is a list of 7 types of rest we need:

Physical rest

As it sounds, physical rest is exactly as it sounds. Bailey wants people to, ""ensure the body can recharge by allowing it to slow down and repair."" Taking naps, going to bed earlier than usual, doing yoga and taking out time to have your lunch peacefully can be some types of physical rest.

Mental rest

Mental rest again is exactly how it sounds - taking a break to recharge mentally when we feel it's difficult to concentrate. For example, unplugging from gadgets, trying positive affirmations or playing your favourite music can help us get some mental rest.

Emotional rest

""Offloading emotional baggage"" is what emotional rest means. Share your emotions with someone whom you love. If you are not comfortable talking to a friend, relative, maybe try talking to a therapist.

Social rest

Social rest refers to, ""restoring ourselves through connecting with our tribe and mentors,"" says Bailey. To put it in simple words, social rest means reconnecting with yourself. Restoring ourselves by talking to our mentor and friends and spending time with people who affirm us are a few things you can enjoy.

Creative rest

To keep yourself energised and find more inspiration, taking a break from creativity is important. Sometimes removing ourselves from our own creativity and turning to the creativity of others can also help. You can simply read a book, go for a walk or look at someone else's artwork. Cleaning your work table and decluttering your room can also help declutter the mind.


Sensory rest

""Retreating from sensory overload by reconnecting with yourself,"" is what Bailey describes as crucial. Turning off your gadgets. getting some fresh air and journaling can help you get some sensory rest. You can go for some outdoor workout or must-try journaling if you haven't done it before.


Spiritual rest

The last form of rest highlighted by the therapist is spiritual rest. She says, ""We need this to feel anchored and realigned with our sense of purpose and harmony,"". Reading scriptures or philosophical writings, meditating and volunteering can help you get spiritual rest. If you haven't tried meditation yet, you can try taking some deep breaths."

Keeping her new diet and lifestyle in view, Bhumi Pednekar recently shared a secret ingredient that she adds to her morning cup of coffee, and you will be quite surprised to know what it is! Take a look at the video she shared:


In the video, one can see her pouring water in a cup, a spoonful of ghee and coffee powder. She whisked the three together to form a nice cup of frothy coffee, which she said she was having after a break of 50 days.
She captioned her post and wrote, ""Ghee + Coffee = Happy Morning. #GoodMorning,"" which was backed by the ""You're the coffee that I need in the morning"" song in the background.

If you don’t know, Ghee Coffee is a high-fat beverage that is considered very healthy when consumed on an empty stomach.


According to health experts, adding desi ghee to the drink makes it effective in weight loss and also gives you the energy. This logic of weight loss is backed by the ketogenic diet, which is very popular these days among people who are willing to lose weight.


It has been proven that the fat content in the ghee is good for the brain, boosts nerve connections and improves the production of hormones in the body which helps in keeping your mood elevated and stable.


It also supplies some calories, derived from fat to get you going and also takes care of the cravings and hypoglycemia, which we usually get from having something sweet in breakfast."

Jasmin comes meanwhile and Aly casually mentions about his deal with Nikki. He said, “Meri abhi deal hui darling Nikki k sath, that when Jaan or I will become captain, we will steal coffee from the BB Mall.”

He goes on to add, “I find her very sweet ya. You know why?” He blushes and so does Jasmin. Jasmin adds, “I don’t like her so you better don’t like her too.” He says it is a game. She says that then he should keep it to himself and his bond or liking for her shouldn’t affect their friendship or game.


Later, Jasmin talks to Aly and discusses captaincy duties with him. She complains how Jaan is not taking the duties he can do and pitching himself for duties where he can pass away time.


Aly is currently inside a glass enclosure and can only communicate with other housemates through an old-school phone.

Arjun Kanungo: I would've proposed to Carla earlier; the pandemic delayed it,"Arjun Kanungo is known for his love songs, but few know that he is a diehard romantic in real-life too. Speaking to Bombay Times exclusively from Dubai, Arjun tells us all about his fairy tale proposal for his girlfriend, model-actress Carla Dennis.
“I wanted to propose to her for a while now, but I wasn’t able to due to the COVID situation. I wanted to make it special, but for a few months, we couldn’t travel anywhere. Then, I realised that we could either go to Dubai or the Maldives. But since we did not have a lot of time, I planned a trip to Dubai. I got a beautiful yacht, we took it out around sunset and that’s when I popped the question. I had the ring ready,” he shares.


Talking about Carla’s reaction, he says, “She was quite surprised. She cried a lot, and then we both got very emotional. We then called our families and everybody was crying on the video call; it was lovely.” They are yet to zero in on a date to tie the knot.

The couple first met on the sets of the music video for Arjun’s breakout song 'Baaki Baatein Peene Baad', and have been in a relationship for over four years. He says, “Carla was the lead in that video, and we kept in touch even after the music video was shot. We started dating a few months later.”


Arjun says that Carla is nothing like him. “We are absolute opposites. She is conservative, I am not. She is very emotional, I’m not. She is a foodie, I wasn’t until I met her. What we have in common are our priorities. We are both family-oriented,” he says, adding, “She has been my biggest supporter in my career. We love music, movies and fashion. Also, we love to travel the world together. Despite the differences in our personalities, we almost always like or dislike the same people.”


The singer, who has songs like 'Fursat', 'Aaya Na Tu' and 'Tu Na Mera' to his credit, is forever crooning when he is around Carla. “I don’t know why, but I always feel like singing when she is around. She likes to hear me sing. Whenever I create a new song, she is the first person to listen to it. I haven’t made a lot of music specifically for her, I probably will do that in the future.”"

We have to live up to expectations,” says Jayathirtha. That's why he’s been brainstorming with his team and the script and dialogues of the sequel are now in place.

“This time though, we have an even bigger surprise in place for the audience. If you thought that the twist at the end of Bell Bottom was unexpected, the twists and turns in this one will be nail biting,” he states. So what’s the highlight of the film? “While the film will once again be of the whodunnit genre, the case that we will be dealing with in this flick, will be a wonderful mix of history and the future, with some intriguing elements of science woven in. There are so many unique chapters of Indian history that are undocumented and we have used such instances to add an edge to our story,” Jayathirtha shares.


The setting of the flick is in the mid 80s, so it will be shot in places that lend a retro feel to the movie. “We are planning to shoot in and around Kollegal, Mysuru, Old Mysuru and North Karnataka,” avers Jayathirtha. The film will have the same cast including the main leads Rishab Shetty, Hariprriya, Pramod Shetty, Yogaraj Bhat, PD Sathishchandra and Sujay Shastry, among others. A few additional characters will come in and music will be by Ajaneesh Loknath.

Meanwhile, Rishab is looking forward to stepping into the shoes of Detective Divakar once again. “This time, he gets a bigger canvas to showcase his skills. There will be lots of action and thrilling moments. Divakar would’ve also moved to a bigger town from the hamlet he lived in,” sums up Rishab."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,"#TheatreLove: Watching movies on the big screen is truly magical, Prem","The first film I saw FDFS was Rajini sir’s Padikkathavan. My friend bought the tickets in black. I guess they cost `50 or something, which was quite expensive back then. I was in school. It was such a huge thrill as my family hardly let me watch films that way. In fact, it is these experiences that kindled in me a desire to enter the cinema industry. I also remember watching Idhaya Thamarai the same way when I was doing my Class 11. These days, I always try to catch the FDFS of films because I do not want the reviews and opinion about the film to colour my experience.


My most memorable moments were seeing myself on the big screen in Nepali and Dhanam. The wonder of seeing yourself on the big screen is something else. I usually like to watch films on the big screen. It is truly magical. And enjoying a film with people, and observing their comments… that provides great feedback.

"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,What are face mask brackets and are they really effective?,"Ten months into the pandemic, we have all made peace with the fact that COVID-19 is here to stay and so are the masks. With time we have all adapted to this change and mask has become the new normal. But we all know that wearing a face mask all the time is not an easy task. The defensive gear against the COVID virus can make it difficult to breathe and even lead to skin irritation and acne. To help overcome this problem a new accessory has recently started gaining popularity: face mask brackets.
What is the use of a face mask bracket?
Face mask brackets are plastic or silicon-based support frames worn under the mask. They are generally pear-shaped, with a narrow top that fits over your nose and a wide bottom that perfectly settles at the bottom of your chin. There is a T-shape structure in the middle that covers your nose and mouth. They have small hooks at each end that can help to secure them onto the inside of a surgical-style mask, creating a barrier between your face and your mask.

These face mask brackets are claimed to make breathing and speaking from under the mask easy. The brackets prevent the fabric from touching your face, creating more breathing space and less friction. Wearing these face brackets can also prevent skin-related issues like masken, eczema and won't smear your lipstick.
Are they effective?
Face mask brackets are still new in the market and no study has been carried out to evaluate its effectiveness. But experts believe that there is no harm in using this accessory unless and until it fits perfectly on your face.

The major issue is the size of the brackets and the kind of mask they are used with. These face mask brackets are specifically made for surgical masks and might not fit well inside all kinds of fancy masks available in the market. The main purpose of a face mask is to create a barrier between you and droplets of other people and an ill-fitted mask can only increase the risk of infection.


The downside

The major downside of using a face mask bracket is the fitting. Most brackets are available in the standard size and might not fit well on everyone's face, creating a gap and increasing the risk of infection. Also, there are high chances that brackets may push the mask off your face if not secured perfectly.


The second flaw is the material used to make these brackets. Indeed these brackets might prevent friction between the face and mask, but what about the plastic and silicon frame rubbing your face. Staying in contact with the plastic and silicon structure for a long time can lead to irritation.


How to take care of your face mask brackets

If you decide to wear the brackets then make sure you clean them properly after every use. Scrub with soap and warm water, just like you wash your face mask. Keep them away from children as it could pose as a choking hazard."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,Anurag Saikia and Gowtham Bharadwaj come together for an independent single,"Assam-based composer Anurag Saikia, who has several films to his credit, including 'Karwaan', 'Article 15' and 'Thappad', has collaborated with singer and musician Gowtham Bharadwaj for an independent single, 'Va Kannamma'. The single is a collaboration that involves artistes from across different cultures and states.

Talking about the song, Gowtham says, “I knew Anurag during the time he studied in Swarnabhumi Academy of Music, in Chennai. I had met him once and we even recorded a song for one of his short films. He later moved back to Assam. We then connected on Facebook and I used to follow his work. He even won a National Award for one of his short films. One day, I suddenly got a call from him asking if I was the same Gowtham, who’d sung 'Aagaasa Veedum Kattum' for 'Dear Comrade'. When I told him that it was me, he was very happy. Anurag told me that he’s been listening to south Indian music. He then told me that he wanted to work on an independent song with me. A few days later, Anurag sent me the track. The tune was breezy, and it felt like someone was singing a song by the river, with his family. We then decided to work on the song in Tamil as he is fond of the language.”

Gowtham got lyricist Viji Viswanathan on board for the song. “Viji has worked with my band Staccato and has been doing some independent work as well. We recorded the scratch last November. Anurag then began work on the song during the lockdown,” says Gowtham. The song’s video is animated by Saurabh Hazarika. Gowtham says, “Viji gave Saurabh a word-to-word translation of this lullaby, and Saurabh worked his magic for the visuals.”


The singer says that he had a fun time collaborating with Anurag after a long gap. “It felt nice to connect with him after a long gap. Working with him was incredible, too,” he signs off."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,Sasi The Don’s upcoming album is all about positivity,"Malayasian Tamil artiste Sasi The Don, who is also known as the Reggae Ambassador of Asia, will be coming out with a new album titled, 'My Second Wave'. The idea behind this album is to spread positivity, boost spirits and life to each other in every way possible. With the first single, 'Humpty Dumpty' ready for release, Sasi says that he had a whale of a time working on this album.

He says, “I’ve been in the music scene since 2002 and the whole process of doing an album has changed. We no longer have to write 10-12 songs, or bring out a CD. Today, there is a lot more thinking that one needs to do before they release a song. In that sense, it was a great challenge for me. The pandemic has taken so much from people and I want to remind them that there is still hope and we need to fight this uncertainty together. Music connects people, doesn’t it? Since I have a platform to speak, I am trying to create a conversation with people through my music.”


The album has six songs, with three bonus tracks. “The three bonus tracks are remixes of my old songs, which was in collaboration with Apachi Indian and Maxi Priest. I wanted to give it a new sound, and add more flavour to it for the new generation. For the six songs, I’ve collaborated with artistes in India, Malaysia and Jamaica. I’d be revealing the names closer to the time I release the songs. For this album, I’ve experimented with writing, different ways of using reggae music and the sound. I’d also worked on quirky titles for all my songs. I wanted it to sound different. The first song,'Humpty Dumpty', is about us and how we rise above all problems we face in our everyday life,” says Sasi.

Working on the album during this time has been a great challenge, says Sasi. “It is not easy to shoot a music video today owing to the present situation. Also, the time difference and coordination was a bit of a challenge. But we need to get used to the new normal and here I am,” smiles Sasi, and adds, “I am kicked about my new album and look forward to releasing the songs one at a time.”"
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Acting has become my passion: Anicka,"Even as she is waiting for her debut film, Jasmine, to hit screens, newcomer Anicka Vikhraman has already completed shooting for two more films — Ikk, directed by Jiivi writer Babu Tamizh, and Sarkunam’s En Paattan Soththu, starring Vemal, apart from a web movie.
Anicka says that she got her first movie offer while she was doing her B.Com in Bangalore. “I was doing modelling, mostly as a hobby, and did a few ad shoots. Jehansaai sir, the director of Jasmine, had seen my still, and felt I’d be right for his film. Since it was a solo lead, I thought I’d give it a try,” begins the actress.

Though she did not have a previous acting experience, this Malayali girl, who was born and brought up in Mumbai, says she was able to perform well in her first film because the character was closer to her real self. “It’s actually a horror movie, about a girl’s life... the moments that a woman faces. She is a girl-next-door type, a carefree girl, a bit bubbly... any girl can do this role because the problems that she faces are something that all women can relate to,” says Anicka, adding, “The language was the only difficulty, and that too, initially. I understand Tamil, but since it was a heroine-centric script, I appear throughout and have a lot of lines, so speaking in Tamil was a problem at first. Now, I am quite fluent in the language.”
While Jasmine was shot for over a year, she signed her second project, Ikk, after watching Jiivi and being mightily impressed by it. “The film revolves around three characters — hero Yogesh, Guru Somasundaram sir, and me. I play a newlywed wife in it. She is very supportive of her husband, who is facing an issue,” she reveals. Playing a married woman wasn’t a concern, she says, and adds, “I think the industry has now gone past beliefs like young actresses should act only as lovers and not wives. You only have to look at Aishwarya Rajesh for proof. She played a mother of two kids in Kaaka Muttai, and that worked wonders for her career.”


Interestingly, within a week after Ikk, she signed Sarkunam’s film, a family drama. “The story revolves around my character, and it is quite a contrast from both my films. I play a village girl who has been to the city, so while she’s traditional, she’s also a bit modern. Even the experience was different as unlike in my first two films, which had minimal cast and crew, we had a huge cast, as my character has a large family — three uncles, their families and all that. And the cast included veterans like Thambi Ramaiah sir and Meera Krishnan ma’am,” she says.


She calls Sarkunam as “a sweet person and a gentleman”. “He is very fast when it comes to shooting scenes,” she adds. And Vemal helped her out with the dialogues, especially the Thanjavur slang, she informs.


Though acting happened by accident, Anicka says she says she became seriously hooked to acting, after her first film. “Acting has now become my passion. I have shifted to Chennai to try my luck here,” signs off the actress."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Vidya Pradeep’s film has a Kamal Haasan connect,"A well-known publicist in Kollywood, Nikil Murukan is now turning actor with the thriller Powder, which stars Vidya Pradeep in the lead.

“I’ve been casting people who have been on the sidelines of cinema for some time. That’s how I cast actors like Charuhasan and Janagaraj in my previous films. Nikil has been working as a PR for 25 years and is well-known in industry circles, though the public isn’t aware of him. So, I decided to cast him in this one,” says the film’s director Vijay Sri G.


Nikil will be playing a cop in the film, and the director says that it will be a role tinged with black humour. “It is a full-length role and he plays a cop named Raghavan. Of course, he is named so as the character will register faster because it is Kamal sir’s character in Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu,” says Vijay.

The only thing he asked of his newbie actor was to tone his body for this role. “Since he has been on film sets, he did not have trouble performing. But I asked him to hit the gym and get fitter as I didn’t want a cop with a paunch. He hit the gym and came back fit following the lockdown,” he says.


The director reveals that he was able to complete his portions as film events have been less than usual during the pandemic. “Only a few scenes of him with Vidya Pradeep are left,” he adds."

Actress Rashmi Prabhakar's latest promo for the serial Manasella Neene, has created quite the buzz online. ""The serial explores the bond between a mother and her child. I play Raaga, the doting mother of Preethu (played by child artiste Alaap),"" she shares. In Manasella Neene's promo, one sees a bubbly mother looking for her son Preethu at her own wedding. ""The promo gives a peek into the rough storyline and I am not at liberty to reveal much about why this woman is getting married,"" says Rashmi, who adds that her character is a stark contrast to that of Chinnu in Lakshmi Baramma. ""Chinnu was a naive and an overly emotional character who would break down time and again, but Raaga is a strong woman who does not compromise, except for her son,"" Rashmi adds.

Rashmi is excited to be working with Shruti Naidu in Manasella Neene. ""She is a huge name in the television industry and it feels great to be a part of one of her projects. She is extremely particular about how the character turns out. Even with the promo she was clear about the colour of the attire that I would wear.

The video also features Darshan Doshi, Frijo Francis, Akshay Anantapadmanabhan, Prashanth Gnanamuthu and Mohit Rao.

Ambi says, ""What's different with this track is that, mostly when we perform a tillana, it is done with Bharatanatyam. But for this track, we had Nirupama and Rajendra perform kathak. They did a contemporary kathak performance which is fantastic. When I wrote this tillana, I wrote it in the Carnatic format, but I wanted to create a contemporary version of it and that's how it happened.""


How is the track different from his earlier tracks? ""It is very intricate in terms of the melody and difficulties. I wanted to turn it into a duet - a duet between the vocals and the violin. It's like they are both equal voices in this,"" he says, adding, ""The video was shot separately and I edited it. My editing skills are slowly getting better. It was a lot of fun to work with the group. Everyone, including lyricist Hari Narayanan BK and the artistes, brought their own element into the track."""
"  Nov 7, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Entertainment,Aindrita Ray: I feel more energetic since turning vegan,"Once a hardcore non vegetarian, Aindrita Ray started 2020 by slowly transitioning to veganism. It was the news of a pregnant elephant dying after a local allegedly fed her a pineapple stuffed with crackers in Malappuram that completely moved Aindrita and hubby Diganth to switch to veganism. “There are many myths around dairy products, especially milk. There is this notion that milk is extremely important for our development, but our body does not require milk after a certain age and, in fact, rejects it. Also, dairy farming is not how it is marketed or advertised; cows are tortured and forcibly impregnated. The calves are stolen from lactating mothers. But nobody cares where the milk is coming from,” Aindrita says, adding, “There are a lot of options for those who want to turn vegan. From vegan milk and cheese to vegan ghee and curd — options are plenty.”

Aindrita, whose personal favourite is her vegan vegetable Thai curry, says she has noticed changes after switching to a plant-based diet. “I have become more energetic and feel light after each meal. Also, I actually became more fit and started rock climbing and doing a host of other physical activities, more than I could earlier,” she says"

Fatima Sana Shaikh, who made a sparkling debut in Nitesh Tiwari’s Dangal, is gearing up for the release of two films now, and in the process, she says that she’s figuring out what kind of actress she is. Relieved that people haven’t forgotten her despite a two-year-gap between previous and forthcoming release, Fatima Sana Shaikh spoke to Bombay Times about the fab cast she’s worked with, finding her feet in a cut-throat business and how we all have to brave this pandemic to tell the tale. Excerpts:
In a chat with us at the beginning of the lockdown, you seemed anxious about not having a single film release since your Diwali release in 2018. And now, you have two films coming out almost simultaneously.
I am so relieved that finally kuch to aaya itne time ke baad. People must have thought I had left, woh do picturein karke (laughs!). Frankly, I have worked hard and now when people are watching the songs and trailers of both the films, I am feeling very happy and relieved that baat aage badhi. Also, I am over that feeling of anxiousness. A lot of things have happened since our last chat. The world around us has changed. Ab mujhe apni bahut saari problems choti lagti hain. I feel I am in a better place than so many others. I am grateful for that.


Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari is a comedy set in the 1990s. You play the girl who the men are fighting over - Manoj Bajpai as the brother and Diljit Dosanjh as the lover. What drew you to this film?
It was a combination of things. The cast is brilliant. I loved the script. I’ve also loved Abhishek Sharma’s films -- Tere Bin Laden: Dead or Alive, and Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran. The project ticked many boxes for me. Plus, the era is familiar to me. I’m a 1990s kid. I belong to that generation. It’s an urban character and it didn’t feel like this was too far off. A character from the 1950s probably would have felt a little distant in that sense. What I also feel is that emotions are the same, irrespective of which time zone the story is set in. The tools to connect and communicate change, but we still say the same things. I got a lot of help from the film’s writing. It was nuanced. My character is from a simple, Maharashtrian family. She’s sincere and shaant, but she has another side which she keeps away from the family.
You were juggling Ludo and Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari at the same time, while, reportedly, nursing your personal wounds. Did that become too much to handle?
On the work front, frankly, there was no struggle. With Ludo, one had no clue what we were shooting the next day. Dada (Anurag Basu) always asked us to trust him and to go with the flow. I followed his instructions to the T and now whatever it is, it’s his doing entirely. He drew out the performances from all of us. But I have to admit that I had fun working with him. With Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari, I was stressed to deliver my best while enacting scenes with so many talented names. There was no room for me to fumble. The only difficult task at hand was to bring in the Maharashtrian accent and internalise the qualities of the character I am playing. But I didn’t have to switch on and off much between my roles in both the films. Other than these things, I am still figuring out what sort of an actress I am. I think I am learning a lot on the sets of my films, while I am doing scenes. I don’t know much about the artiste in me. I hope I find her soon, bas woh karte karte kahin barbaad na ho jaaoon.


Does acting make you feel liberated; does it give you the room to let your real emotions pour out without anyone noticing?
I think I am more comfortable playing characters than playing myself. While playing a part, you can be who you want to be without being judged. Even if you are expressing your own emotions on screen while doing that, it’s still something that you’re enacting which is written by someone else. No one will judge you for that. I feel very liberated in front of a camera. I can be anything and anyone. There is nothing better than having the chance to live so many lives and emotions in one lifetime.


In the course of the lockdown, the industry was under the radar for nepotism, drug addiction and more, following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. As someone from a non-film family, you had a stint as a child actor and now, you are a leading lady, how did all those conversations and news reports make you feel?

These things don’t affect me at all. People have time to talk about this today, tomorrow, they will find some new topics to discuss. I don’t get upset about nepotism and unfairness. Every industry and every generation have seen things which are unfair. It has always been about the survival of the fittest. Nepotism is a part of every industry, not just cinema. If I have gone through struggle, made a lot of effort and created a space under the sun, I would like my child to be the next in line for the space that I created. I wouldn’t like him or her to go through the grind. It would be totally unfair if there was no opening for outsiders. We have Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Manoj Bajpai and others who are stars, despite being outsiders to the business. I am getting work. Siddhant Chaturvedi is an outsider whose work speaks for itself. So many of us have been embraced by this industry. So, what is the point of cribbing? We knew when we entered that there will be an Us v/s Them situation; it was an unfair game from the word go. If you want things to change, you will have to make the change yourself. That will create a tomorrow which is different from today. Being bitter is not an answer to anything. Voicing opinions is great, attacking is not.


You’ve been in Dharamshala for two months now. How does stepping out in the new normal feel like?

It feels normal; as humans we adjust and adapt so quickly to things around us. As a race, we have seen so many things and braved it all to tell the tale. Wearing a mask is second nature now. Six months ago, it would have felt like an ordeal. It doesn’t hurt anymore."

Renovation of our house was shut midway amid the lockdown. With so many at home ill, and the incomplete house, I can’t even imagine how my family spent time there since I was in a separate house due to my four dogs.” Having emerged safely from COVID, Wamiqa says all she feels now is gratitude. “I feel we are lucky we had the means for dadi’s treatment, and had food on our plates. So many people lost their jobs and lives. It has made me spiritual now.” The lockdown increased the number of dogs Wamiqa owned, from one to four. “My dog was in Mumbai and I got her to Chandigarh after the state borders reopened. Till she hadn’t arrived, I was missing her and would bring home Mandy’s (Takhar) dog. Eventually it became my dog as Mandy gave her to me. Then, an animal welfare NGO in Amritsar had rescued street dogs and asked me to help find them a home. I don’t know what came to my mind, I adopted one of them. When shooting resumed, I had to travel to Lucknow and went for COVID test. There I found another abandoned pup and got her home too.”

Wamiqa had completed shooting for two Punjabi films pre-pandemic, Galvakdi and Kaun Hai Yar and did two Punjabi music videos, Mausama and Kajla after lockdown.

She has become one of the first Punjabi actresses to migrate to the digital platform. “The kind of work I always wanted to do, is happening now. As an artist, I have had beautiful, magical moments shooting for them. I don’t discern between OTT and theatre because this is incredible work that I ‘chose’ to do.”

Having done South cinema, Wamiqa says Punjabi industry needs to explore elements to catapult it higher. “As a Punjabi, I feel we need to buckle up with more discipline. Punjabi is a growing industry and we need to be more professionally aligned with other industries.”"

While the couple has not confirmed anything yet, fans are quite curious to know if the couple is expecting their first baby.



Vatsal Sheth and Ishita Dutta tied the knot on November 28, 2017, in a very private and intimate ceremony. The couple fell in love while working with each other on Rishton Ka Saudagar – Baazigar. Interestingly, Vatsal and Ishita had signed a no-dating clause while working on the show. The TV show Rishton Ka Saudagar – Baazigar ended but the couple developed feelings for each other.


Vatsal and Ishita hardly dated and decided to get married soon after seeing each other within a few months.


During an interview with ETimes TV, Vatsal had opened up about why they decided to have a private wedding, ""I was very clear that I want a small and private wedding. There were just 30-40 people at our wedding. I still feel very bad because I didn’t even invite my own cousins. I called them and told them the reason. We wanted to keep it very very small. Our wedding got over in an hour.""


The husband-wife kept their fans entertained throughout the lockdown by creating funny videos. They also worked on their personal hobbies like painting, playing flutes. Ishita and Vatsal also shot a short film amid lockdown by staying indoors, which got positive feedback."

They keep abusing each other and also use foul language.
All this happens during the luxury budget task. Bigg Boss announces the luxury budget task wherein the house is divided into ‘Angels’ and ‘Devils’. With Rubina Dilaik, Pavitra Punia, Jaan Kumar Sanu and Abhinav Shukla in the ‘angels’ group, Eijaz Khan, Aly Goni and Nikki Tamboli are in the ‘Devils’ team. Jasmin Bhasin, captain of the house becomes the anchor of the task.

The Devils go all out in order to win the budget task and make the Angels do some tough tasks. From forcing Rubina to pour chutney on her head to making Jaan put his hand in the toilet seat, the devils do it all.

Here, Eijaz keeps insulting Jaan by asking him to remove his clothes then shave his beard. Jaan sportingly plays the game. Later, Eijaz crosses all limits and insults Jaan, trying to ignite anger out of him and break his ‘Angel’ image. This leads to a massive fight between the duo.


They call each other names and Jaan comes out of the house. They also get into a physical fight but are stopped by Nikki and Ali Goni. They even abuse each other. He breaks down and tells that he has always considered Eijaz to be his big brother and he is really upset by the way he has behaved. Later, Jaan goes and apologises for abusing Eijaz Khan and the latter tells him that his mother is no more and he shouldn't have got parents in the fight.


However, by the end of the episode, Jaan goes and hugs Eijaz tightly. Do you think they will go back to being normal?

" Nov 7, 2020, 01:32 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,Give your home a touch of gold,"It’s the year end — the start of the festive, party and marriage season. The style highlight at this time is shimmer when it comes to outfits, bags and shoes, with gold being the fave shade. But why only look your best in this hue? Dress up your home in shiny gold to get it ready to welcome the festive celebrations. Says Shilpa Rajesh, interiors specialist, “Gold can give a luxurious update to any room in the house. It is is versatile and blends beautifully with natural materials like jute and wood. It would be a good idea to go subtle with it as this is a strong colour. You can use it to highlight a particular area, like having a photo frame or a single chair or coffee table. It definitely adds a warm tone to the space.” Here are ways to bring the metallic hue into your home...

Relax on a rich ottoman




Make a stylish statement with a chic, gold ottoman in square or rectangle shape, that is placed at the end of the bed. This is a multifunctional piece of furniture that can also double up as a table.

Muted gold cushions




It need not always have a dazzling effect. Go with muted gold velvet cushions to dress up your sofa or add a fringe of gold to your other printed pillows and cushions. Place them just about anywhere.


Spells luxury in the bedroom




Give your bedroom a Victorian touch with gold panelling on the bed, a brocade bedspread, tasselled cushions and a quilt in the hue. Looks elegant for sure.


Light it up



For a fun kitschy touch, place these decorative candle bottles around the home. They can also be made DIY-style. Says Radhika Jasani, Andheri-based homemaker, “I made these myself at home and they were such a hit. All you need to do is clean and dry the bottles and spray paint them in gold colours. Add long white candles inside and you are set.”


Lamps




Another opulent touch to the home can be achieved with gold lamps in table top or hanging style. Go with a basic modern lighting design in burnished or gleaming gold.


Minimalist furniture



If you are someone who doesn’t want to go overboard with the hue, opt for subtle accents in the furniture, like a single chair or table edging. They go well with coloured walls. Says interiors expert Nishita Kulkarni, “Gold actually accentuates neutral shades — whites, beiges and greys. In fact, the gold-grey combination is a staple in home decor.”



Dramatic touch to the bathroom




There are several ways to add gold to your bathroom. From cabinet pulls to taps, countertops and a mirror, gold lends a sophistication to the bathroom. You can also have gold-themed tiles for dramatic effect."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 01:00 IST",Srishti Dasgupta,Lifestyle,#SayYesToGhee: Give a trendy twist to your old kitchen staple,"Good old ghee, a superfood with oodles of health benefits, has been a staple in Indian kitchens for ages now. But how many of you have actually used it as an oil alternative in your regular cooking? True, it has been used for ages now in desserts and sweets in Indian households and also as a taste-enhancer. But according to experts, it is one of the healthiest alternatives to cooking oils, if used in moderation and at the right temperature.
According to nutritionist Dr Ananya Bhowmik, though ghee is rich in cholesterol, some fat-soluble vitamins like A and E are also present in it in good amounts. “Ghee is full of antioxidants and helps boost our immunity too. My suggestion is that people should have a tablespoon of it every day. They can have vegetables tossed in ghee, accompanied by a roti or toasted bread. There are also healthy spreads available in the market now in which palm oil is being replaced by ghee. You can also add a spoonful of ghee to any kind of soup to enhance its taste and health quotient. After all, fat is a necessary component in a balanced diet,” she adds.

The chef’s perspective

Home chef Debjani Guha Biswas says two-three tablespoons of ghee is a must as an immunity booster during the pandemic. “Ghee is absolutely a natural product and increases the good cholesterol levels in our body. It is a good immunity booster as it’s full of antioxidants and keeps cough and cold at bay,” she says. To this, home chef Madhushree Basu Roy adds, “For Bengalis, ghee is a big part of the diet, as most vegetarian dishes rely heavily on ghee, which is added at the end to enhance the aroma and flavour.”



According to Chef Auroni Mookerjee, it is important to know how to use ghee, as it is a superb ingredient in terms of the nutritional value and flavour. “The nutty-silky richness that ghee brings to the palate is unparalleled. But the higher the temperature you cook it in, the heavier and unhealthier it becomes. So, we should try our best to not deep fry anything in ghee. Instead, we should use it as a finishing or garnishing ingredient to add flavour to a dish.”



Innovative dishes get a healthy twist with ghee

Paleo eggs benedict


In this new version of the good ol’ eggs benedict, ghee forms the basis of the hollandaise sauce. It’s combined with turmeric to provide an anti-inflammatory health boost.


Granola bars with ghee


If you are a fitness freak, then granola bars surely comprise your post-workout meal. Nowadays, granola bars with ghee as an important component are available. You can also make gluten-free homemade granola bars by replacing the oil with ghee. You can also add ghee to your oatmeal or porridge during breakfast.

Red wine spaghetti


Yes, you read it right. Red wine, ghee and some groundnuts make for the sauce in this spaghetti pasta dish. Both red wine and ghee, as we know, have loads of health benefits.


Moringa leaves fried with ghee/ moringa soup with a dash of ghee



Moringa or drumstick is a superfood that helps improve eyesight, fight against cancer, convert fat into energy and also aid weight loss. Moringa leaves if fried with ghee or mixed in a bowl of soup with a dash of ghee is not only healthy but tasty too.

Chocolate or fruit-based spread with ghee




A recent innovation in the health food sector are bread or chapati spreads made of chocolate, blueberry puree or banana caramel mixed with ghee. The traditionally used palm oil in such spreads is fast being replaced by ghee.

Bollywood divas who swear by the goodness of ghee

Kareena Kapoor Khan




Kareena, who has embraced ghee as part of her postpartum weight loss diet after delivering Taimur, continues to include it in her daily diet. Even her nutritionist, Rujuta Diwekar, has often talked about the goodness of ghee. Kareena, who loves ghar ka khana by her own admission, got back in shape fast enough to give us major fitness goals after her delivery. And the secret ingredient seems to be desi ghee, which is part of her daily diet.

Malaika Arora


Malaika gets her morning kick with a cup of bulletproof coffee, which is nothing but low-fat or black coffee mixed with a tablespoon of ghee. This ketogenic beverage has helped Malaika lose weight and she stays energetic throughout the day. The actress had shared a picture of her ‘fat first’ coffee on her Instagram story
a while back, inspiring fitness enthusiasts to opt for the healthy energy drink.

Shilpa Shetty Kundra



Shilpa surely seems to be ageing in reverse. The 45-year-old actress, who swears by yoga to remain fit and healthy, religiously consumes two tablespoons of ghee every day, apart from jaggery, brown rice, dal and turmeric. In one of her interviews, she was also heard saying that American popstar Madonna also loves to have her toasts with a spread of ghee."

"  Nov 7, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,Make your own homemade soap and gift it to friends,"This is a DIY project that friends and family will love. Pretty homemade soap wrapped in ribbon, a spring of lavender or with a little cinnamon is one of the nicest gifts to give anyone and as it has no harmful chemicals, it's kind to the skin, too. Here's how to go about making it at home with just a few ingredients and a few neat skills...
WHAT IT IS
In essence, a bar of soap is a mix of fat or oil and an alkali called lye, which is sodium hydroxide. These are mixed and heated in a process called saponification to result in soap. Don't forget to have your thick rubber gloves, safety goggles and an apron on before you begin.


Lavender soap



Make your lye solution by slowly adding sodium hydroxide to distilled water and stirring it carefully. Always wear a mask and gloves when doing so. In another pan, melt the olive oil and cocoa butter and mix the lavender and perhaps patchouli (for fragrance) essential oils into it. Stir it well and pour this into a mould. Allow it to set and then cut into a slice or a shape that you need.


Aromatic rose soap



Rose soap with its oils is a skin treat as it nourishes the skin, softening and conditioning it. You will need rose essential oil and rose petals for this. Prepare an infusion of rose petals and hot water in a glass jar. Wear your goggles and gloves and slowly pour the lye into the rose infusion. Add olive oil and shea butter in it. Pour it into moulds and once semi-set, slice it into bars. You can also add a few smaller rose petals at this stage.



Citrusy lemon soap




Heat water in a saucepan and met some unscented glycerin soap into it. Once it starts to melt, add lemon zest to it. Remove and add essential oil to it. Pour it into the moulds and set."
"  Nov 7, 2020, 01:00 IST",,Entertainment,Kunchacko Boban: We are all extra cautious now. That's the new normal,"Kunchacko Boban, like most actors in the industry, resumed work just over a month ago completing his portions for Martin Prakkat’s Nayattu. The actor is now shooting his second project post the pandemic lockdown – Nizhal, which also has Nayanthara.

Talking about how life in the film industry has changed, he says that he is missing the conversations they used to have during the shoot breaks and the fun that evolved out of them. “Things have become really formal and that’s kind of sad. Now, everybody does their job and leaves. However, I am very optimistic that we will eventually get back to how things were,” says Kunchacko.


Nayattu, which the actor was busy with before the lockdown, only had a few more days of shoot left that included crowd scenes. “Before we resumed, I wanted to watch the entire footage of what we shot till then. Shooting after a break and that too the climax sequence was a challenge. So, I told Martin about it and we watched whatever we shot, discussed it and then resumed. The movie was shot in chronological order, so the character inside me also evolved knowingly and unknowingly,” he says.


At the sets, the actor says everyone was excited about getting back to work. “Everybody was positive and thrilled. While saying, ‘Start, camera...’, someone asked if the cameraman remembers where the switch is,” he laughs. “Even the crowd sequences were shot with the support of police.”



Post Nayattu shoot, the actor isolated himself at a hotel in Kochi, and after a few days joined the sets of Appu Bhattathiri’s debut directorial, Nizhal.



“The biggest difference shooting for Nayattu and Nizhal is that here everyone is in PPE kits. It was a little awkward initially as we could recognise people only if they remove their masks. But now we have gotten used to it. Everybody in the set is extra cautious and we all have prioritised our safety more than anything else. It has become the new normal. Only difficulty we are facing is while shooting outdoors, but we have been choosing spaces with less footfall,” says Kunchacko, who will be shooting for the movie till the end of this month."

"  Nov 8, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,"#TheatreLove: Movies are basic form of entertainment, says director Ahmed","Even as the central government has announced that movie theatres can be opened from October 15 with 50 per cent occupancy, there is still uncertainty over how audience would embrace the new theatre experience. In this column, celebrities reminisce about catching their fave films at theatres and the magic of the movie hall...

Movies have been an integral part of every middle-class household in Chennai; and we are no different. The ambience of theatres, the taste of popcorn, and the magical smell inside the hall were the things I enjoyed during my childhood. We used to go as a family for Tamil, English and Hindi films. Though I loved watching Rajini and Kamal films, I used to wait for movies of directors like Balu Mahendra, and Mani Ratnam. Nayagan from Anand, Bloodstone from Devi, and Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak from Star were a few movies I remember watching in theatres with great fun then.


Watching Rajini in a Hollywood film and seeing him in a different avatar and talk in English in it gave a special kick to us. Safire theatre used to a screen films round the clock, and we would go and watch whenever we feel like. Mani sir’s Idhayathai Thirudathe was another film we enjoyed to the core. The film influenced us in terms of dressing sense of Nagarjuna and other stars. Those days, super hit songs of Rajini and Kamal films were used to play repeatedly, it was an unparalleled fun. Two films I enjoyed in the recent times was Mad Max: Fury Road and 1917. The latter in IMAX format was breathtaking.

As far as audiences returning to theatres is concerned, it might take a little time, but I’m sure youngsters are raring to go, if a good film releases. I don't know if 50 per cent occupancy will be viable for theatre owners, but all section of viewers will gradually come. This is the basic form of entertainment for a middle-class family in Tamil Nadu."
"  Nov 8, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,Ayyappa plays an astrologer in his next,"The team of the Sharan-starrer Avatara Purusha has been busy wrapping up the final portions of the film and joining them in the latest schedule is Ayyappa. The actor, who was last seen in Bharaate along with his brothers P Ravishankar and Sai Kumar, will play an astrologer in the film.

“ Ayyappa's portions date back to the 60s, so, we had to find the right ambience to convey a vintage feel. We chose the historic quarters of Srirangapatna, as we didn’t want any modern roads or buildings in our visuals,” explains director Suni. And, more importantly, the story has a reference to Paschimavahini. “Since river Cauvery is known as the Paschimavahini and starts flowing towards the west at Srirangapatna, we felt it would be the apt location for the subject. There’s a stunning view of the pristine river bed and the rocks and Ayyappa sir has so convincingly played his part. It was a pleasure working with him,” sums up Suni.

"  Nov 8, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sindhu Vijayakumar,Lifestyle,Budget-friendly and convenient: Gift cards are popular this season,"Gifting is a tricky affair. Especially, for an occasion like Deepavali, you might have an endless roll-call of people to gift. Each gift needs to be considered based on its uniqueness, age and liking of the recipient, one’s budget, etc. Sangeetha, a tutor, says that choosing a gift for her brother is always a daunting task. “He is very choosy and it’s quite difficult to please him with the gifts that I buy for him,” she says. But this time for Deepavali, she got it right. How come? “I bought him a gift card from a general retailer. He splurged it on gadgets he wanted and was happy,” she smiles.
Of late, many like Sangeetha prefer gift cards over spending time endlessly, searching for that perfect gift you think the other person will like (with no guarantee). Nandita Rajesh, a corporate employee, tells how thoughtful it was for her friends to give her gift cards when she was going through a rough patch. “Those gift cards let me do some online purchases and pamper myself with some spa treatments,” recalls Nandita, saying it allowed her to take her mind off her problems she faced then. Also, gift cards allow one to buy whatever he/she likes without the guilty feeling of splurging money. “Hadn’t I got gift cards from my cousin and sister, I wouldn’t have done Deepavali shopping this time, considering the financial stress at home now,” states Soundarya, a youngster.

If some people think that a gift card is impersonal and lacks creativity, the fact is that it is the best bet when you don’t know the recipient’s liking. “I agree,” states Christopher G, an MNC employee, and adds, “But if it offers a unique experience to the recipient, it’s cool.” Thanks to social media, people do their bit of research before buying even a gift card, opines Ramani R, management professional. “They’re up to date with the trends. Imagine providing someone the experience of dining at a fancy restaurant by giving them a gift card that the place offers. That will definitely be cherished by the recipient than receiving an object as a gift,” he says plainly.
Reasons to go for a gift card
Budget-friendly: Gift cards come in different denominations. Buy a gift card depending on your budget.
Convenience: Gift cards usually come with a longer validity period. It allows the recipient to redeem it at his convenience.

Happiness quotient: It gives the recipient the freedom to buy what he/she likes for that specified amount. Won’t that bring a smile on his/her face? For sure.

Saves time: It only takes a few clicks to buy a gift card online. It eliminates the time spent on choosing the ‘perfect’ gift you might think the recipient likes.

Eliminates duplication: Worried if you might end up buying something the recipient already has? A gift card eliminates the chances of duplication.


Two smart ways to use gift cards

See how much extra you can pay and buy what you really love to have
Look for sale and discounts if the terms and conditions on the card don’t restrict such purchases

According to the findings of Research and Markets, a market research store, in value terms, the gift card market in India during the period 2015-2019 saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.2% and the e-gift card market is estimated to grow and record a CAGR of 32.6% during the period 2020-2024"
"  Nov 8, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,Director Kuldeep Cariappa's viral title reveal leaves fans curious,"Recently, images of a white sheet with 'Nodidavaru Yenantare' written in bold, black letters, went viral on social media. Many in the industry received it, leading to much curiosity. “That is exactly what we had intended to do. It sent people into a tizzy over what this could be. Those who knew me, reverted with their versions and those who didn’t know who it was from, were left wondering. I got some hilarious replies like 'Nodidavaru Yenantare, Ee Saka Cup Namde; Nodidavaru Yenantare, Idu Nammane Daily Kathe' and others along these lines,” shares director Kuldeep Cariappa, who has directed short films earlier.

The replies may have been light-hearted, but the subject of the upcoming film is rather deep. “It is about a hero who is dejected and goes into introspection. He wants to run away from everyone and everything - in short, from life itself. The movie is about his explorations and learnings of life,” states the director. Nodidavaru Yenantare stars Naveen Shankar of Gultoo fame and Apoorva Bharadwaj who has done a few art films prior to this flick. “We have already shot 70 per cent of the film and had to halt mid way, due to the pandemic. The title hadn’t been revealed yet and we came up with this innovative plan to promote it. We are so glad that Sriimurali sir revealed it on Thursday,” says an elated Kuldeep. The film features music by Mayuresh Adhikari and lyrics by Jayanth Kaikini.

"  Nov 8, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Entertainment,Get into fitness mode like these B-Town ladies pre-Diwali,"Diwali is just around the corner, and our B-Town celebs are all set to enjoy the festival of lights, even though it will be rather low-key this year. The celebrations will obviously include bingeing and gorging on Diwali delicacies. But at the same time, they are already upping their workout regimes to balance it out. Whether it is practicing yoga, pole dancing, cycling or hitting the gym with a vengeance, these stars are setting new fitness goals for themselves and inspiring the rest of us. Let’s take a look...

Diana Penty

What: Cycling




Cycling is a great way to knock off the calories and the flab as you fit into your festive lehenga. Cocktail actress Diana Penty looked cool as got on her cycle dressed in a baby pink tracksuit. This seems to be her resolution for the year as she captioned the picture with
these words, “Wanna ride away into 2021.” Pedalling away on an open road does sound destressing, doesn’t it?
Yami Gautam

What: Yoga




'Bala' actress, Yami Gautam can also give you major fitness goals through her yoga asanas. She posted a series of moves as well as their benefits — from vrikshasana or the tree-pose that can improve balance and stability in the legs to a baddhakonasana (throne pose) variation to increase flexibility in the knees and inner thighs as well as krounchasana or the heron pose that stretches the ankles and leg muscles. In a post, she shared a little yoga-lophy as well. Penned the actress, “Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self”.

Malaika Arora

What: Yoga




Wanna get rid of that belly fat and strengthen your muscles? Get into a yoga sweat a la Malaika. She’s an ardent practitioner of yoga and regularly shares pictures doing different asanas and throws light on the benefits of each pose. Her fans look forward to the move of the week that she shares on her account. In one of her moves, she shared how to do the inverted yoga posture, in another she shared about the parsvakonasana or the extended side angle pose for stronger, tighter and sculpted abs. For that complete stretch, take a cue from her crescent moon pose.


Taapsee Pannu
What: Meditation



With the festive season in full swing in the coming weeks, it is bound to have you longing for some quiet ‘me time’ to help you realign your thoughts. Taapsee Pannu shows how. She took to her balcony space for some quiet meditations as part of her yoga regimen. Sharing a picture of herself in that mode on Instagram, she wrote: “Like most of us, I always thought that yoga is just about twisting our body into complicated contortions and about being a human pretzel. Sitting on the mat every day for a few minutes, trying to tune in even when infinite thoughts might interfere, offers as many benefits to our body and mind. The act of meditating is actually classified as ‘Upasana Yoga’ in Yogic scriptures.”


Sunny Leone

What: Aerial fitness



To get flexible, observe Sunny Leone. She’s been inspiring people to take to home workouts and seems keen to learn the ropes of gymnastics. Recently, she posted a video of herself performing cartwheels and aerial fitness. While giving us a peek into her aerial fitness regimen, she wrote, “Who said trying new things was easy!! I’ll get it...you’ll see... lol now stop laughing at me (sic).”


Kriti Sanon

What: Chakrasana



Kriti Sanon just performed chakrasana or the upward bow pose, which is a backbend. She called herself a ‘work in progress’ and wrote, “I thought of putting this up, then I felt its not Perfect! But why does everything have to be perfect anyways?? #WorkInProgress. If you aren’t Evolving, You’re not really Living. You’re just passing through Life! —
Kriti (sic).”


Kriti Kharbanda

"  Nov 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,"After Love Mocktail, people now recognise me even with my mask on: Rachana Inder","Actress Rachana Inder made her debut in Sandalwood with Love Mocktail this year. Her chirpy, playful character struck a chord with viewers. Hence, it's no surprise that she's busy now, with two plum projects. She has Tribble Riding alongside Ganesh and Harikathe Alla Girikathe with Rishab Shetty.


""When the pandemic struck and the lockdown was imposed, I had very few film offers, mostly with newcomers. But, as soon as the lockdown was lifted, it seemed like almost everyone wanted to do movies and there were offers galore,"" Rachana tells us, adding that acting was always part of her plan and she thought she would give it a shot with Love Mocktail.

Rachana says the appreciation she has received is immense. ""I have received a lot of love and appreciation for my character in Love Mocktail. Everyone recognises me not by my name, but by my dialogue 'Henge Naavu', which they recite and send me on social media too. It is astonishing that they recognise me even with my mask on. It makes me feel extra special,"" she adds.

She is now shooting across Karnataka for her upcoming films and loves that she will be busy till December. ""In Tribble Riding, I play a talkative and energetic person. I think filmmakers usually see you basis the first impression you give them in your debut. So, I am getting more roles that are similar. I want to try my hand at subtler roles. But these projects will give me that base before I try out more roles,"" says Rachana.


She further continues, ""I'm set to join the set of Harikathe Alla Girikathe soon. They've offered me a very good role. I'm one of the leads and while it again shows me in the talkative and energetic mould, there is something more."""

"  Nov 9, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,The world is insensitive to people even when they are recovering from Covid-19: Tamannaah Bhatia,"Tamannaah Bhatia recently recovered from coronavirus and called the experience a ‘scary’ one, revealing that she even faced the thought of death at one point.

Talking about the same in a podcast, the Baahubali actress said, “I was really scared when getting treated, there was a constant fear of death in me. I had very severe symptoms that I knew had killed others on their way to recovery. But the doctors truly saved me and I should thank my parents too for standing in support. It made me realise how valuable life truly is.”


While the thought of dying is daunting by itself, Tamannaah revealed that the aftermath wasn’t pleasant either, especially when she would get body shamed. “How insensitive can people around us be? I was on heavy medication throughout the process which made me look heavy. There are many who called me fat when I posted a picture. It showed me how some can’t see through what the person has gone through and instead, just look for flaws.”

Tamannaah Bhatia is currently busy with three major movies in Tollywood. The actress is playing the role of a kabaddi coach in Sampath Nandi’s Seetimaarr along with Gopichand. She will also play lead roles in Gurthundha Seethakalam which is the remake of Kannada blockbuster Love Mocktail, with Satyadev as her co-star and Tabu’s character in Andhadhun’s Telugu remake along with Nithiin and Nabha Natesh."
" Nov 10, 2020, 00:15 IST",Pallabi Dey Purkayastha,TV,Asmita Sood: The lockdown has made me realise nothing’s better than home-cooked food,"In a video interaction with Bombay Times, the actress told us that she had used the lockdown phase to hone her culinary skills, and is now whipping up one sumptuous cake after another.

“During the lockdown I did learn to make a lot of food because I was home and I was with my family. My mom taught me how to make a lot of Indian food and she also taught me how to make different non-veg dishes. She doesn't eat any non-veg food but she taught me how to make it because my dad loves non-vegetarian food. During the entire lockdown, I was the one cooking food for dad like whenever he would want to have chicken or anything so that was that was good. That was a great learning and also there were no there were no cake shops open so I learned how to make a lot of cakes and I made banana cakes, chocolate cakes, walnut cakes and apple cinnamon cakes. Um, yeah, I made a lot of cakes and I made tiramisu. I made a lot of desserts because I love dessert. I just cannot, my day end without dessert. So I made a lot of desserts and it was great. If you talk about the kind of food that I like, I would say that I think the lockdown has taught me that there's nothing better than good food. There's nothing better than having good food but if you don't have home cooked food, I would say that Italian is my favourite. I have not learned how to cook it yet but it is something that really rings my bells all the time. So I like it. It's really nice (sic),” said Asmita."

" Nov 10, 2020, 00:15 IST",,Entertainment,"Exclusive: Cinema shapes our society, so it’s important we conserve it forthe future: Sonam Kapoor Ahuja","“We may live in a digital age, but we live in an analog world. For me, analog remains a powerful storytelling tool,” said filmmaker Christopher Nolan, a strong advocate of celluloid, during his visit to Mumbai in 2018. He shot portions of Tenet in the city a year later, but his first visit was specially dedicated to promoting the cause of film preservation and thus, supporting filmmaker Shivendra Singh Dungarpur’s Film Heritage Foundation. Sonam Kapoor Ahuja is the latest to support film preservation initiated by the foundation.


Talking to Bombay Times from London, Sonam says, “They’re doing such a

wonderful job. In just a few years, they have built a movement for film preservation and I felt it was very important for me to support a cause that is committed to preserving our film legacy. As an actor and even a cinema lover, I would always want to go back to cinema from any era and learn from it.”

The actress explains, “In India, films are a religion and that’s for a reason. They are an important part of all of our lives, right from our childhood to our growing up years. As audiences and cinema lovers, it’s our responsibility to preserve and restore our cinema for the future generations. There are many classics of Indian cinema that are lost and many that need to be preserved. Sadly, as we have not preserved our films, we don’t get to watch these movies beautifully restored as they should be. We must conserve it for more people to come and see our culture, our cinema and the beautiful light that these films bring in our lives.”
Looking at films on a broader perspective, she adds, “Films give us hope, happiness, love and sometimes, even the courage to lead our lives the way we deep down want to. Hindi cinema has played a very important role in shaping our society so it’s important we secure it and conserve it for the future. I’m really honoured to be associated with this foundation.”"
" Nov 10, 2020, 00:15 IST",,Entertainment,"Alex Trebek, long-running 'Jeopardy!' host, dies at 80","LOS ANGELES: Alex Trebek, who presided over the beloved quiz show ``Jeopardy!'' for more than 30 years with dapper charm and a touch of schoolmaster strictness, died Sunday. He was 80.

Trebek, who announced in 2019 that he had advanced pancreatic cancer, died at his Los Angeles home, surrounded by family and friends, ``Jeopardy!'' studio Sony said.


The Canadian-born host, who made a point of informing fans about his health directly, spoke in a calm, even tone as he revealed his illness and hope for a cure in a video posted March 6, 2019.
In the video, Trebek said he was joining the 50,000 other Americans who receive such a diagnosis each year and that he recognized that the prognosis was not encouraging.

But Trebek said he intended to fight it and keep working, even joking that he needed to beat the disease because his ``Jeopardy!'' contract ran for three more years. Less than a week later, he opened the show with a message acknowledging the outpouring of kind words and prayers he'd received.

``Thanks to the _ believe it or not _ hundreds of thousands of people who have sent in tweets, texts, emails, cards and letters wishing me well,'' Trebek said. ``I'm a lucky guy.''

Messages of grief and respect from former contestants, celebrities and the wider public quickly followed news of his loss.

``Alex wasn't just the best ever at what he did. He was also a lovely and deeply decent man, and I'm grateful for every minute I got to spend with him,'' tweeted ``Jeopardy!'' champion Ken Jennings. ``Thinking today about his family and his Jeopardy! family _ which, in a way, included millions of us.''

``It was one of the great privileges of my life to spend time with this courageous man while he fought the battle of his life. You will never be replaced in our hearts, Alex,'' James Holzhauer, another ``Jeopardy!'' star, posted on Twitter.

John Legend tweeted that he was ``obsessed with Jeopardy as a nerdy kid growing up in Ohio. I've loved and revered Alex Trebek since I can remember. What an iconic career.''

``Jeopardy!`` bills itself as ``America's favorite quiz show`` and captivated the public with a unique format in which contestants were told the answers and had to provide the questions on a variety of subjects, including movies, politics, history and popular culture.

They would answer by saying ``What is ... ?'' or ``Who is .... ?''

Trebek, who became its host in 1984, was a master of the format, engaging in friendly banter with contestants, appearing genuinely pleased when they answered correctly and, at the same time, moving the game along in a brisk no-nonsense fashion whenever people struggled for answers.

He never pretended to know the answers himself if he really didn't, deferring to the show's experts to decide whether a somewhat vague answer had come close enough to be counted as correct.

``I try not to take myself too seriously,'' he told an interviewer in 2004. ``I don't want to come off as a pompous ass and indicate that I know everything when I don't.''

The show was the brainstorm of Julann Griffin, wife of the late talk show host-entrepreneur Merv Griffin, who said she suggested to him one day that he create a game show where people were given the answers.

``Jeopardy!'' debuted on NBC in 1964 with Art Fleming as emcee and was an immediate hit. It lasted until 1975, then was revived in syndication with Trebek.

Long identified by a full head of hair and trim mustache (though in 2001 he startled viewers by shaving his mustache, ``completely on a whim''), Trebek was more than qualified for the job, having started his game show career on ``Reach for the Top'' in his native country.

Moving to the U.S. in 1973, he appeared on ``The Wizard of Odds,'' ``High Rollers,'' ``The $128,000 Question'' and ``Double Dare.'' Even during his run on ``Jeopardy!'', Trebek worked on other shows. In the early 1990s, he was the host of three _ ``Jeopardy!'', ``To Tell the Truth'' and ``Classic Concentration.''

``Jeopardy!'' made him famous. He won five Emmys as its host, including one last June, and received stars on both the Hollywood and Canadian walks of fame. In 2012, the show won a prestigious Peabody Award.

He taped his daily ``Jeopardy!'' shows at a frenetic pace, recording as many as 10 episodes (two weeks' worth) in just two days. After what was described as a mild heart attack in 2007, he was back at work in just a month.

He posted a video in January 2018 announcing he'd undergone surgery for blood clots on the brain that followed a fall he'd taken. The show was on hiatus during his recovery.

It had yet to bring in a substitute host for Trebek _ save once, when he and ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak swapped their TV jobs as an April's Fool prank.

In 2012, Trebek acknowledged that he was considering retirement, but had been urged by friends to stay on so he could reach 30 years on the show. He still loved the job, he declared: ``What's not to love? You have the security of a familiar environment, a familiar format, but you have the excitement of new clues and new contestants on every program. You can't beat that!''

Although many viewers considered him one of the key reasons for the show's success, Trebek himself insisted he was only there to keep things moving.

``I'm introduced as the host of 'Jeopardy!', not the star,'' he said in a 2012 interview. ``My job is to provide the atmosphere and assistance to the contestants to get them to perform at their very best,'' he explained. ``And if I'm successful doing that, I will be perceived as a nice guy and the audience will think of me as being a bit of a star.``

``But not if I try to steal the limelight! The stars of `Jeopardy!' are the material and the contestants,'' he said.

In a January 2019 interview with The Associated Press, Trebek discussed his decision to keep going with ``Jeopardy!''

``It's not as if I'm overworked _ we tape 46 days a year,'' he said. But he acknowledged he would retire someday, if he lost his edge or the job was no longer fun, adding: ``And it's still fun.''


Born July 22, 1940, in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, Trebek was sent off to boarding school by his Ukrainian father and French-Canadian mother when he was barely in his teens.


After graduating high school, he spent a summer in Cincinnati to be close to a girlfriend, then returned to Canada to attend college. After earning a philosophy degree from the University of Ottawa, he went to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Co., starting as a staff announcer and eventually becoming a radio and TV reporter.


He became a U.S. citizen in 1997. Trebek's first marriage, to Elaine Callei, ended in divorce. In 1990, he married Jean Currivan, and they had two children, Emily and Matthew. Trebek lived with his family in Los Angeles' Studio City section, not far from Hollywood.


Trebek is survived by his wife, their two children and his stepdaughter, Nicky."
"  Nov 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",Pallabi Dey Purkayastha,Lifestyle,"This festive season, swirl in your shararas","They are flared, flirty and oh-so-gorgeous… The classic party pants with a traditional twist, also known as shararas, are becoming a rage this festive season. From monotone and multi-coloured shararas to sequinned and handwoven ghararas (the millennial answer to its conventional counterpart), this piece of garment is a sure-shot ticket to turning heads at parties — be it a cosy family get-together or a fiesta where you’re hobnobbing with the hoi polloi.


So, what makes them timeless? Versatility! “As you can see, shararas are quite versatile. Whether you wear them in the same print or contrasting style, the silhouette itself is trendy and never goes out of fashion. Whether you team it with a midriff-baring crop top or with the quintessential kurta, the flouncy sharara promises to be your saviour. And it can be styled in so many ways,” believe designer duo Rimple and Harpreet Narula.


Stylist Mohit Rai adds, “Like we know, the sharara is a very modern outfit, which is primarily a skirt, but bifurcated in the middle. So, while you look all festive, you also have the comfort of wearing pants. One can jazz it up with an embellished jacket, a blazer — since winter’s set in some parts of the country — or even a shirt. To complete the look, add a piece of statement jewellery or even a belt if you’re feeling experimental.”"

"  Nov 9, 2020, 01:00 IST",,Entertainment,Dhyan Sreenivasan: I'm more confident scripting a thriller than a romcom,"Dhyan Sreenivasan seems to be making a habit of roping in lady superstars for his scripts; his debut directorial Love Action Drama featured Nayanthara and his next script 9MM, which will be directed by Dhinil Babu, has Manju Warrier in the lead.

“I always wanted to associate with Manju chechi in a project. I bounced off the thread of 9MM to Manju chechi during a random phone call during the lockdown. It’s based on a real-life incident that happened in Chennai. It piqued her curiosity and she said it could be an interesting subject if I could develop it further. So, I used the time during the lockdown to read more about the incident and shared it with her. Once, the entire script was ready, I narrated it to chechi and that’s how she came onboard,” says Dhyan, adding that he has been fortunate to work with lady superstars including Shobana since he made his entry into the industry with Thira in 2013.


Ask him how much directing Love Action Drama and the audience’s feedback help in scripting 9MM and he says, “Both belong to totally different genres. 9MM is more of an action thriller with one half having a lot of action sequences. Love Action Drama, meanwhile, was made on a bigger canvas and was a mishmash of a lot of genres as evident from the title. With romcoms, there’s always the risk of the comedy or the romantic scenes not connecting with the audience. But content-wise, thrillers always have a focus and as a director and scriptwriter, it gives you the confidence that you can convince the viewers based on how well you tell the story.”

9MM will mark the debut directorial of Dhinil Babu, who had earlier worked in films such as Mayanadhi, Prathi Poovankozhi and Parava. The team is planning to begin shoot of the movie, which also has Sunny Wayne and Dileesh Pothan, only next year. “Most of the movie will be set in Chennai and Coimbatore, and the scenes require crowds. So, we will wait till after the pandemic to begin filming,” says Dhyan, who will also be acting in 9MM.


Meanwhile, during the lockdown, the actor says he had been working on at least three scripts. One of which could be his second directorial venture – a family drama with Nivin Pauly and Aju Varghese. “We still haven’t finalised anything about it right now and that’s why we decided to go ahead with 9MM first,” says Dhyan, who also has a host of acting ventures lined up including Kadavul Sagayam Nadanasabha that has him playing a private detective."
"  Nov 10, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Entertainment,City teen Tanya Shanker's debut album is about the trials and tribulations youngsters face,"Bengaluru-based singer Tanya Shanker is all set to drop her maiden album, Battlefield, this month. The 14-year-old singer, who turned to professional singing only two years ago, says that the album is all about teenage trials and tribulations. ""For instance, the song Love Hasn't Found Me Yet, which released one week before the album, is about love that teenagers experience. The name Battlefield came to us because it is a metaphor for every teenage mind. In general, a teenager goes through so much peer pressure, external and internal conflicts, and more. Each song in the album has a certain level of conflict,"" says the singer.

Richard Dudley, Tanya's mentor and producer of the album, says that Love hasn't Found Me Yet is about teenage crushes. ""At this age, teenagers experience love in different forms and, sometimes, rejection. But the song also is about hope, because there is a line that says ‘But I'll wait for that perfect someone’,"" says Richard.


The album, which releases on November 14 has seven tracks in pop rock genres and features artistes like Manou Rao from France and Yogesh Pradhan from Girish and the Chronicles. ""As a singer, the album allows me to push my limits. Pop rock is something that comes to me naturally. While some songs were out of my comfort zone, Richard helped me fine-tune the songs. This helped me recognise my strengths and weaknesses,"" says Tanya.

What can audiences expect from the album? ""It’s a musical treat. We have international artistes like Manou performing as well. There's a purity that comes from a young heart, which the album captures beautifully and both teenagers and parents will be able to relate to this,"" Richards sums up."

On the other hand, Ariyana and Sohel argued over their differences. However, towards the end of the task, the two pledged to be nice towards each other.

Post the nomination task, Ariyana told Avinash that except him, the rest of the house had 'ganged up' against her. As Avinash tried to pacify her adding that she will be the first contestants to be saved, Ariyana stated that she wanted to leave the house adding that she can't stay anymore with everyone turning against her."
"  Nov 10, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,"In pop culture, there’s too much emphasis on toxic masculinity: Diljit Dosanjh","Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh apparently started getting marriage proposals after people got a glimpse of his character in the trailer of Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari. Not that the Punjabi pop star didn’t before, but the ladies seem to have taken a special liking for this role. The film directed by Abhishek Sharma also stars Manoj Bajpayee and Fatima Sana Shaikh.

Set in the year 1995, Diljit, in the film, plays Suraj Singh whose life turns topsy turvy when Madhu Mangal Rane — Manoj – enters his life. The latter runs a detective agency that does a background check on prospective grooms. Talking about the rishtas coming his way, Diljit told BT, “The trailer has received a great response and people have loved my character Suraj, and rightly so. He is warm and affable.



It’s important that mainstream films highlight relatable boys like Suraj. In pop culture, there’s too much emphasis on toxic masculinity and all the trappings that it entails. A family loving, accha munda needs to be popularised over the prevalent idea of bad boys that films have normalised. Suraj is all heart, and I am happy that people are liking him. Good guys need to be celebrated.”"
"  Nov 10, 2020, 00:46 IST",Neha Maheshwri,Entertainment,Rakul Preet Singh: The biggest celebration would be when the pandemic ends,"Diwali is around the corner, and like millions of people across the country, Rakul Preet Singh, too, hopes that the festival of lights will dispel darkness in more ways than one. “I really hope that Diwali brings in a lot of light in everyone’s life. Having said that, the biggest celebration would be when the pandemic ends. This Diwali, it makes no sense to crib about not being able to host or attend big parties or meet a lot of people. This is the time to understand the bigger picture, follow the new normal, celebrate and pray at your home. Also, situations like these make you realise what true celebration of life is — who are the people who really matter to you, how negligible you are on the face of this planet and what true joy is. The pandemic has put everything into perspective.”

Elaborating on her Diwali plans, she shares, “I will be shooting in Hyderabad till November 12, followed by a two-day break. I haven’t started planning. In fact, my family and friends always do all the planning and I just join in. In any case, it’s going to be a small celebration in Hyderabad with just a handful of friends. Usually, I also celebrate with street kids. I will be doing that this year, too, while adhering to the safety guidelines.”


Rakul says that she has no plans of indulging in retail therapy this Diwali. “I will make do with whatever I have. Staying healthy is more important than going out, buying clothes and then feeling bad about it. I always look at the brighter side; all of us are doing well, our families are healthy, and the COVID-19 mortality rate isn’t very high. That’s reason enough for us to celebrate. Of course, I miss the Diwali rituals of buying new clothes and jewellery, but it’s fine. I think we can do enough of that later,” she says.

Along with celebrations, festivals are also all about nostalgia, and it’s no different for Rakul. For her, Diwali signifies an important life lesson as well — the joy of sharing. She recalls, “As kids, my brother and I used to love firecrackers, and our parents would indulge us. But, one Diwali, when I was 10 years old, my father gave me ` 500 and asked me to burn the note. He told me, ‘This is exactly what you do when you buy crackers, you burn money. So, you buy some chocolates instead and distribute it among street kids.’ Since then, I stopped bursting crackers and started celebrating with the lesser privileged. Even a small gift can bring a smile on their faces. So, I urge everyone to spend the money they are planning to splurge on crackers, to help the needy. Also, we have had enough environmental damage, and this is a sign for us to understand that we need to protect the planet.”"

We hear that she’s going through a weight training routine. It’s tough, but the results of it are evident in her snaps. The actress has added some muscles to her frame and she definitely ups her strength quotient with it. Buzz is, she also works out so she can eat whatever she wishes to.

Speaking about this, Benafsha says, “I am blessed with great genetics, but I also put in the hard work. I am doing decent weight training four days a week and that's keeping me in good stead. I think that entirely changes the body. I don't count my calories when I eat and I can't restrict myself too much with food. I am just getting my macros on point and I find that to be a total game-changer.""


Is the hard work for an upcoming project? Will have to watch and see. Meanwhile, the actress was in Goa recently with her friends from college and she had some fun in the sun. It was a totally relaxed time where she indulged in seafood and spent time on the beach and enjoyed the sunsets."

"  Nov 10, 2020, 01:01 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,"Producers call for boycott of new releases this Deepavali, Qube to take up the issue with CCI","While movie lovers have been looking forward to catching up with new films for Deepavali after several months of lockdown, Tamil Film Active Producers Association (TFAPA) has announced that they are not interested in releasing new films as they are not happy with the terms associated with the Virtual Print Fee (VPF).
On Monday, TFAPA issued a statement mentioning that they are not going to release new films following the terms of VPF suggested by the digital service producer (DSP), Qube Cinemas Technologies. Qube, too, came up with a statement and condemned the boycott by TFAPA and termed it unethical. According to Senthil Kumar, co-founder of Qube, says, “We have offered a 60 percent discount on VPF, but producers want us to waive it completely. We have made several crores of investment and we had zero revenue in the last eight months. Theatres, too, can’t take it anymore. When the government has granted permission for exhibitors to function, producers have been stubborn and selfish. Unlike they assume, here, the VPF rate is low. On an average, the current rate is `10,000 per screen for a movie while it is `70,000 per screen for a movie in the US. For Bharathirajaa’s film, Meendum Oru Mariyathai, which was released earlier this year, it was a little more than `4,000 per screen. The amount involves mastering, delivery, key management, quality check screening, and censor screening. In the US, only for mastering, they charge 5,000 dollars. ”

Senthil alleges, “Every time producers’ election is around the corner, they do something like this. I don’t understand the rationale behind issuing a statement when the talks were going on. If things do not get resolved before Deepavali, we plan to take up the issue to the Competition Commission of India (CCI).”
Producer Dhananjayan, vice president of TFAPA, claims their demand is a permanent solution for VPF, but Qube has been offering only temporary measures. He explains, “Every time, it is the producers who have to bear the brunt of such unclear terms. They have now offered a 60 percent discount till March — they haven’t said what is the plan post-March. We need a permanent solution. We have never asked them to waive off VPF completely.”

Senthil counters that they offered a temporary solution considering the occupancy restrictions in the theatre. He adds, “Exhibitors have now got a chance to attract the audience, but they are left in the lurch as producers are not cooperating. Bollywood producer Ronnie Screwvala has approached CCI to waive VPF, but CCI said that there isn’t anything unfair with the terms associated with it.”

Tirupur Subramaniam, president of Tamil Nadu Exhibitors Association, released an audio clip in which he has requested the state government to hold talks with DSPs and producers. He said, “Producers say they need a Hollywood model of VPF, but they aren’t ready to follow Hollywood when it comes to terms between exhibitors and producers. When every other industry is releasing films following VPF terms, why does the Tamil film industry alone need a separate rule?”

Meanwhile, another DSP, UFO, has announced that it will not charge VPF from producers for November 2020. “While we have been suffering huge losses, we feel that it is important for the film industry to open up in a big way during festival season of Diwali. With this object in mind, we have decided to waive all the VPD/CDC for new films released in November 2020 across India, (sic)” their statement read.

"  Nov 10, 2020, 01:03 IST",Srishti Dasgupta,Lifestyle,"Canary yellow, maroon, teal blue, bottle green: Rich and vibrant hues rock this festive season","Staying fashion forward always adds fun to the festive mood. When you’re picking up any attire for a special occasion, one of the key factors is the colour of the outfit, apart from its cut or design. Pick up colours that are in vogue this season and complement your skin tone. To turn your Diwali a little brighter, try canary yellow, maroon, teal blue and bottle green, apart from pastel shades.

Warm colours a must this festive season



According to fashion designer Debarun Mukherjee, colours like red, maroon, yellow and bottle green are dominating hues this year. Any warm colour adds the much-needed spunk to your festive attire. “This is the time to make ourselves happy, more so because the major part of this year has been so tough for us. The dark times are still not over but that should not stop us from lifting our spirits. So, dress up in bright hues and celebrate safely with your friends and family. The colour trends of this season are anything bright and beautiful. In my festive collection this year, I have included hues like red, maroon, bright orange, haute pink, nude gold and different shades of blue. Each colour signifies a mood and gives out a specific message,” he adds.


How colours can be a reflection of our mood




This festive season is all about celebrating colours. Since the pandemic broke, people have seen such gloomy days that they now feel the need to cheer themselves up with bright and bold colours. Fashion designer Abhishek Dutta says, “Canary yellow, tangerine orange and aqua colours are trending this festive season. Our festive collection mostly comprises these bright hues to give out a positive vibe with relaxed styles and interesting prints.” He further adds that each colour has a significant effect on us aesthetically and psychologically. “While hues like canary yellow and tangerine remind us of happy shiny days, shades like teal blues and aqua are all about calmness and serenity. Colours definitely work as mood changers and are essential in these desperate times,” he shares.


Yellow, blue or warmer tones — what’s your pick?





If you browse through your last year’s festive wardrobe, you’ll find scarlet red, maroon and even black were the dominating colours. But for 2020, as actress Swastika Dutta tells us, apart from the staple red, her pick for this year is haute pink, sea blue, purple, bright yellow and ivory. “For me, wearing the right coloured outfit for the right occasion is a must. When it comes to Durga Puja or Diwali, red has always been a dominant colour in my wardrobe. But this year, apart from red, I have bought clothes in shades of yellow, fuchsia pink, sea blue and green. Bright colours are instant mood lifters. Also, the key is to keep your makeup and jewellery minimal, if you are flaunting a bright colour,” she adds.




Stylist Ankita Banerjee also echoes similar thoughts. She says, “Festivities mean bright colours and one of the predominant colours this season has been shades of blue. People are also opting for earthy colours, like browns, beiges and nude gold to keep things subtle. Apart from these colours, quirky prints and easy silhouettes are a trend this festive season rather than heavy embroidery since celebrations have mostly turned into house parties or a relaxed outing just with a handful of friends. Gone are the days when women would go heavy with their makeup and jewellery during festivities. I believe a nude-makeup look with some statement piece of jewellery should do the trick and make you stand out in the crowd.”

"  Nov 10, 2020, 01:03 IST",,Entertainment,Chennai International Film Festival pushed to February 2021,"The Chennai International Film Festival (CIFF), which is the biggest film festival in Tamil Nadu, will not happen during December this year and has been rescheduled to February 2021. The fest is the latest cultural event to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Organised by the Indo Cine Appreciation Foundation, with support from the Government of Tamil Nadu, the Chennai International Film Festival has been a regular feature in the city since 2002. This year would have marked the 18th edition of the festival, which is attended by many film buffs and film students.


In a press release, the organisers of the festival informed, ""We wish to inform that due to the pandemic we have rescheduled our 18th Edition of our Chennai International Film Festival to 18-25 February 2021 instead of December 2020.""

However, they did not reveal details about the films that are likely to be part of this edition of the fest.


They only stated that the format of CIFF will remain the same. ""As usual, we will have the following sections in the festival. 1. World Cinema 2. Tamil Feature Film Competition 3. Indian Panorama 4. Retrospective 5. Country Focus,"" they noted and added that ""Further details will be furnished in due course"".


Given that COVID-19 situation has forced the government to enforce strict safety measures to contain its spread, the festival, which usually witnesses screenings of films from across the world, in many theatres across the city, certainly comes with safety challenges. The government has only now given permission for movie halls across the state to open again, and they will be reopening today (November 10)."

Members of the film industry in India showed overwhelming support for Harris through their social media posts almost instantly. Mallika Sherawat, who played a character based on Kamala in her Hollywood film, Politics of Love (2011), remembers meeting her in the course of her prep for the role. Talking to BT about Harris, Mallika says, “Kamala Harris’ win as a Vice President-elect of the United States of America is historic. Not only is she the first woman to occupy the office, but she’s also the first woman of colour and the first Asian-American to hold that office. She gives hope and a voice to the voiceless. She’s led her life by example and gives incredible hope to young girls and women all over the world.”

Recalling her meeting with Harris while preparing for the film, she adds, “She was extremely helpful when I met her while prepping for Politics of Love. I played a Democrat volunteer who’s half-Indian, half-African-American in the film. I remember she gave me great advice. She had told me to try to keep the character balanced, and the film to represent both sides - the Democrats and the Republicans. I was feeling like a fish out of water in Los Angeles at that time. It was a different country and culture, but Kamala put me at ease. I remember her telling me, ‘Getting out of your comfort zone is good to build character, it will make you a stronger person’.”"
"  Nov 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",Debolina Sen,Lifestyle,"How to buy the safest, freshest Diwali treats","Diyas, sweets and savouries and all kinds of gifts brighten up your Diwali every year. This year, too, shouldn’t be any different, despite the ongoing pandemic. But the extended lockdown and the prolonged closure of businesses could also translate into some vendors trying to push old or stale stock. And since you wouldn’t want to end up gifting stale dry fruits or expired chocolate hampers, here are a few tips to make sure your gift is fresh and worth every penny.

Pick the right namkeens

Though many households prefer to make Diwali namkeens such as murukku and chivada at home, it is always convenient to buy pre-package namkeens to add to your gift box. However, this is also the time when markets are flooded with fake brands that have logos similar to established ones. This year, there is a variety of gourmet and healthy namkeen options too. Just make sure you read the list of ingredients, packaging and expiry dates carefully before buying.
Mandatory gift box tags It’s extremely important that the food items are sold well within the expiry date. So, checking the expiry date, import date and other licenses is important. Also, you need to be mindful that there are no firecrackers or inedible decorative items in the boxes. These tend to react with the food articles and cause them to become poisonous
— Dipankar Das, ex-DO for Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, KMC


How safe are pre-packed chocolate boxes?
Chocolates have a long shelf life. And because it’s November, the weather is cool, one can even courier them without running the risk of them melting in transit. Only chocolates with fruit pulp and dairy fillings may not last more than a month
— Vinay Sethia, city confectioner


Dos & Don’ts for buying dry and fresh fruits
Go for vacuum-sealed packages of dry fruits
Check appearance, colour and taste to ascertain whether dry fruits are fresh
Buying seasonal fruits is prudent
Don’t put fruits in airtight bags while gifting
Dos & Don’ts while buying sweets
This Diwali is all about cracker-shaped sweets like chocolate bomb, badam tubri, badam kalipataka and so on. They are individually wrapped keeping in mind the hygiene and quality. Dry fruits-filled sweets are the best option because they have a longer shelf life and it’s also healthy to have almonds, cashews and pistachios. It’s best to avoid chena-based sweets because they have a short shelf life and tend to go sour. Same goes for milk sweets. Over all, all boxes mention packaging dates, ‘best before’ information etc, which help customers choose the right products
— Muktesh Gupta, owner of a sweets shop


Sweets for diabetics

People with diabetes can eat whatever they want during Diwali if they know the intake quantity. If a person has two rasgullas, then a diabetic person should have half. They should also eat slowly, which is called snail eating. For diabetic people, the best gift would be homemade sweets like high-protein laddoos. All it requires is almond powder, peanut butter and honey. Dark chocolate cookies are another good option. Sugar-free kaju katlis made from cashew powder and fat-free milk are also good

"  Nov 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,Unmarried women are more at risk of hypertension,"According to the data from the Global Burden of Disease, hypertension results in 1.63 million deaths in India in the year 2016.
Hypertension increases your risk for other medical problems like stroke and heart disease, which again are the leading cause of death in both women and men. And while we all know that being overweight, lack of exercise and a poor diet are some physical factors that raise your risk of high blood pressure. A new study found that certain social influences such as marital status are also linked to the condition.

The study

In a recent study published in the Journal of Hypertension, scientists analyzed data from 28,238 Canadian men and women aged 45 to 85. These people were participating in an ongoing study on ageing. The data was used to determine the association between marital status, living arrangement, social network size and social participation and hypertension by gender.
The findings

The study found the influence of marital status on hypertension risk for women. Single women have a 28 per cent higher risk of hypertension as compared to their married counterparts. Divorced women have 21 per cent higher risk and widowed women have 33 per cent higher risk.

The findings were the opposite for women

It was found that, when it comes to hypertension, men actually seemed to benefit from being single. In men, lone-living men were lower at risk of hypertension as compared to co-living men.


Having fewer friends raised hypertension risk in women. Women who also had fewer friends were 15 per cent more likely to have high blood pressure.


Social ties and men

While it was found that social ties were important for women, they had very little influence on the risk level for men. Not even the size of the social network nor the level of participation in social activities were found to have any significant association with high blood pressure, found the study."

When we reached there Gautham was patiently explaining the scenes to the film’s lead actors, Varun and Raahei, and the actors were giving their best to perfect the shot. Said to be a spy thriller, Joshua... would’ve released by this time, but because of the pandemic, the shoot was halted. Now, the team is trying to wrap up the shoot at the earliest.

Gautham says that the movie is an out-and-out action film. “We roped in stunt director Yannick from France; he’s worked on Dhruva Natchathiram, too. Yannick has brought in style and panache for the hitman character. Varun went through some rigorous training in France for this and you will see the difference in his body language and the way he moves,” says the director.


Ask Gautham about working with relatively newcomers Varun and Raahei, and he says it has been a great experience. “It’s interesting as you get to mould them exactly the way you want, and you can experiment as well. It has been a learning experience for me, too,” he adds.

The filmmaker has been working with a limited crew and followed all safety precautions. “We did COVID-19 tests for everyone. We ensure we don’t get anyone new to the set. All the actors are advised to stay in isolation at home after the shoot. And yes, masks, face shields, temperature checks are done every morning to ensure safety,” he signs off.


‘Working with Gautham sir is a dream come true'

I feel lucky to be making my debut through a GVM sir film. I am sure many aspiring actresses would want to feature in his film. Working with Gautham sir is a dream come true. He is ‘captain cool’ and makes us comfortable. I play Kundhavi Chidambaram, a role so challenging yet different, in the movie. I had trained in martial arts for the role. There is so much scope for my role and I will appear throughout the film. It feels great to be back on the set. — Raahei,female lead


‘Gautham sir is a patient teacher’

I play a hitman and a bodyguard in the film. We have wrapped up most of the action sequences, for which I trained under Yannick in Paris. Now, we are shooting for the romantic portions for the song, Naan Un Joshua. I can see that side of Gautham sir... the magic of romance that he brings on screen. Gautham sir is so perfect that he takes care of even the minutest details. He is a very patient teacher and I have never seen him lose his cool. He encourages us a lot as well. I haven’t ever seen him get tensed or worked up on the set. We were supposed to shoot the rest of the portions abroad, but owing to the situation, we will be wrapping it up in Chennai.

"  Nov 11, 2020, 00:00 IST",Thinkal Menon,Entertainment,DSP Vs producers: will the VPF waiver pave the way for more new film releases for Deepavali?,"Tamil Film Active Producers Association (TFAPA) and Qube, one of the digital service providers (DSP), were at loggerheads over Virtual Print Fee (VPF) because of which there was an uncertainty over the release of new Tamil films, especially for Deepavali. But in an unexpected move, UFO, another digital service provider, announced that they are ready to waive VPF for the month of November. And now, Qube, too, has joined the fray. Will this announcement pave way for more Tamil films hitting screens this weekend?
Bharathirajaa, head of TFAPA, issued a press note yesterday, in which he said, “We never have any intention to hurt any individual producers or exhibitors. As DSPs have announced that VPF has been waived off for this month, we have decided to release films for two weeks. However, we firmly stick to our decision of not paying VPF to release films after two weeks’ time (sic).”


However, T Siva, general secretary of TFAPA, says these offers by the DSPs can’t solve the issue forever and they want a permanent solution. He points out, “It is not impossible for Qube to agree to our fair demands. But they behave as if it is a Himalayan task. Now, they have waived VPF for this month, but what about December? We have always wanted a permanent solution, and hence, attempts to lure us with these kinds of offers won’t work. We have been unnecessarily paying an amount as VPF all these years. That said, we are hopeful of finding a solution after more rounds of discussions.”

Senthil Kumar, co-founder of Qube, says that their decision to waive VPF for this month wasn’t an impulsive one and that they had suggested it during their earlier discussions with producers. Their decision was made public when UFO announced its offer. He adds, “There are many individual producers who are keen to release their movies, but are facing immense pressure from TFAPA. I hope Irandam Kuththu, which has announced its release, hits screens this festival. If they agree to our offer for November, we will give them a 50 per cent discount on VPF from December. They should realise that it is a good offer.”


Santhosh P Jayakumar, director of Irandam Kuththu, avers that his duty was to finish the movie and get it ready for release on time. He explains, “As per the agreement, I have the film ready, and I will promote the movie as the hero and director if the producer wants me to. As the VPF amount has been waived, it is likely that a huge number of exhibitors will screen the film. We will get to know the exact number of screens and special shows only on the day of release.”

Years before that, they had all adorned bridal attires in their respective films, creating the image of a dulhan that inspired millions of Indian girls across the world. “We can never dismiss the fact that people love Hindi movies and it’s an inseparable part of our popular culture. So, whether it’s Madhuri Dixit-Nene from Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), Kajol from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), or Anushka Sharma in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (2016), bridal attires from films have always captured the imagination,” says Nisha Kundnani, who runs a styling consultancy for NRI brides and grooms-to-be. “No bride works with her imagination alone. She needs a strong reference, and nothing beats Bollywood in that department. With my experience of dressing up brides globally, I can say that for NRI families abroad, Bollywood is a mirror to India’s popular culture, including the wedding trousseau,” she adds. Shnoy, a stylist who works closely with Alia Bhatt and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, says, “Deepika’s regal looks in films like Bajirao Mastani (2015) and Padmaavat (2018) have inspired thousands of brides, although what she wore in these films were not exactly shaadi ka jodas. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s bridal looks from Devdas (2002) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008) are also timeless. I have seen so many girls wanting clothes and jewellery like hers from those films even now. It has inspired brides all over the world.” He adds, “The bridal looks of Kareena Kapoor Khan in 3 Idiots (2009), Alia Bhatt in 2 States (2014) and Kalank (2019) and Aditi Rao Hydari’s bridal get-up in Padmaavat have also worked well. These looks have got the nod from brides because actresses, who flaunted them, owned them completely.”

Stylist Eshaa Amiin concludes, ""Since India is Bollywood-driven, films add aspiration value to an attire. In the past few years, so many brides have referenced Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma’s looks from their films. The best part is that brides personalise and add to the look."""

While he had been busy shooting for his films, the actor says he didn’t feel the need to speak unless he had something solid to convey. But now, he is ready for a conversation because he has something new to share — he has turned music director with Susienthiran’s film, in which he’s paying the lead. In an exclusive chat with us, Jai talks about his love for music, movies and more. Excerpts from our interview:
You are doing two films with Susienthiran now…
The first film is with Bharathirajaa sir and I feel the best person to talk about that is Susi sir. The second film with him is an action entertainer. He narrated the script to me over the phone. He told me he wanted to do an action film, on the lines of Naan Mahaan Alla and Pandiya Naadu. I am a huge fan of his Naan Mahaan Alla. In fact, Susi sir is among the top five directors that I’ve always wanted to work with. When I heard the script, I loved it. The film will have bits of comedy and romance in the first half, followed by intense action in the second half. I play an innocent guy… certain things will change the course of his life. The film is set against a village backdrop. We shot the film in Dindigul, Theni and Vadipatti. Meenakshi (of Kennedy Club fame) is playing the female lead, and we also have Jayaprakash, Bala Saravanan and Harish Uthaman in it.


We hear that you’ve gone through a fitness transformation for the film…
I had put on a lot of weight while doing films like Balloon, Kalakalappu 2 and Neeya 2. Susi sir asked me to knock off a few kilos as I needed to sport a lean look in the first half. I began my weight-loss journey and lost 14 kilos before we began shooting. It was a combination of diet, walking and cycling. In fact, STR and I started our weight-loss journey together. When gyms reopened, he and I worked out together at a fitness centre for a couple of weeks.

You are also making your debut as a music director. How did that happen?
The director of the web series I’m doing saw my studio when he came home for a narration. He’d asked if I’d be interested to compose music for it. I didn’t want to take it up at that time as I didn’t know if I would be able to pull it off. But he heard a song I’d composed and used it as a track while shooting. Susi sir heard that song and asked me if I’d be open to doing music for the film. I was confused, but he pushed me to work on it. I composed a song on my phone while shooting and he really liked it. He convinced me and we got five tunes for the film. He also roped in Vairamuthu sir to pen lyrics for the first song, a romantic number.

But when did you develop a passion for music?
I was always into music. Deva pa (his uncle, composer Deva) has been inspiring us since we were young. Before Bhagavathi happened, I was studying western classical at London Trinity College. I had finished 5th grade, and that’s when I was called for the film. Once I started getting more offers to act, I didn’t have time to pursue music. However, my industry friends used to ask me for ideas and suggestions when it came to music. Later, I also set up a studio in my house. I have composed nearly 500 songs over the years. Even though my family is into music, I didn’t want to be influenced. For this film, we’ve used a lot of live instruments and recorded in Deva pa’s studio. All the five songs will be new in terms of sound. Deva pa, too, is very happy that I’ve finally made my debut as a composer.

So, will you be juggling both music and acting now?
Absolutely. Now that I have gotten into music composing, I will strive to become one of the top 10 music directors in the industry. I’ve gained that confidence after composing for Susi sir’s film.

You had gone underground for a brief period. Why?
When it comes to films, I feel I don’t know what to talk about them. The director is the captain of the ship and it will only make sense if he talks about the film. But now, I’m a music director as well, and I feel I need to talk about my music. And yes, I definitely want to see more of myself now, and will talk in the right place and at the
right time.

In a career spanning 13 years, you have seen both ups and downs. How do you see your journey?
Deva pa had spoken to me about handling ups and down when I made my debut. He said, ‘When you climb Mt Everest, you have to come down because you can’t stay there forever’. We can’t learn if there are no ups and downs in our career. I know the value of my presence, the love I receive and always try to learn from my mistakes. While doing Subramaniapuram, I felt my maturity level was low. At that time, I didn’t take proper decisions. But now, things have changed. Susi sir’s film is my 30th movie and I am happy that I got to work with at least 25 newcomers. More than debating about a hit or flop, I feel happy to have launched new directors. Venkat Prabhu, Sasikumar, Atlee, Saravanan… all of them were first-time directors. I am generally a positive person. If I give a flop, I know that I have my entire life ahead to give another hit.

Directors on my list

Wedding woes

Jai had said that he’d settle down after Arya gets married. So, is marriage on the cards now? “Enga anna STR irukaaru,” he says with a laugh, “You should ask him first. I didn’t know Arya would settle down! He gave me a shock. But now, I have STR anna… I’ll settle down only after him.”"
"  Nov 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,"This Deepavali, home chefs take over commercial confectioners","While the pandemic saw a rise in the number of home chefs across the country, dishing out tasty meals one after another, the recent festivals have proved to be a boon for them. With the festive season right around the corner, home chefs are now taking it a notch higher — churning out sweets and savouries that have been a part of their family for decades, while also serving healthy versions. Here’s a glimpse...

Homemade taste, hygiene and quality gives home chefs that winning edge

“Most of my customers are bachelors, who look for ghar ka khana. They rely on home chefs like me even during festival time because they say that the food we prepare reminds them of their home,” says Trupti Patil Kalgutkar, a makeup professional from Bengaluru, who began cooking from her home during the pandemic and has already begun making sweets like besan laddu, rava laddu, chiroti and more for the festivals.

Ramya N, a working professional from Bengaluru, says that given the current situation, ordering food and sweets from home chefs is a safer option. “Unlike commercial establishments where there are multiple workers producing food in bulk, home chefs take extra care about hygiene, there are minimal people involved in the cooking process and the quality is great. Another great aspect about home chefs that I really like is that they make food in a staggered manner and the way they pack the food items, they ensure that there is minimal physical contact with whoever is carrying/delivering the food,” says Ramya.

For Mumbai-based PR professional and home baker Averil Gouria, the need to prepare healthy sweets/desserts rose from her own needs. “After my godmother said that she was craving sweets, but couldn’t have what was available due to health reasons, I did my research and realised that there were not many players in this market who catered to those who required healthy sweets. I took it upon myself to make healthy sweets, at home, without any artificial colours or flavours and were tasty as well. Now, with Deepavali around the corner, I am working out an interesting hamper that includes sweets like Baked Quinoa Laddus, Baked Gurpara, Tahini and more — all healthy,” she says.

Spreading love through family recipes and dishes

Chennai-based Girija Venkatachalam has been serving sweet and savoury snacks for many decades now. However, this year, she says the trend of gifting sweets and savoury items has picked up. “Since many people are not visiting their friends or families, they have been ordering Deepavali hampers through us, which we deliver to the customers. While earlier, people used to order sweets and snacks for their own consumption at home, this year, due to the pandemic, the number of orders for gifting purposes have shot through the roof. In fact, we had to close orders early, so that we could prepare the sweets and other items at home. Unlike commercial establishments, we do not prepare sweets and other items in bulk. We prepare them in small batches and dispatch it to our customers, says Girija, adding, “For Deepavali this year, we have included sweets like Cashew Katli, Butter Maaladdu, Dry Fruit Mittai and more. The recipes we use have been in the family for ages and so they are unique in taste.”"
" Nov 12, 2020, 10:14 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,"Take a cue from Deepika Padukone, Kangana Ranaut and other celebs to look bold in gold this Dhanteras","From Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, where she wore a body hugging gold gown, to Elizabeth Taylor’s iconic gown in the 1963 film Cleopatra – on-screen celebrities have often set the standards high as far as sporting gold is concerned. The latest on this list is Kim Kardashian, who rocked a tight mini golden skater on her 40th birthday. Closer home, it is not possible to dissociate the ageless beauty Rekha, from gold. You also have actresses like Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone setting fashion meters soaring in gold. This festive season, here’s a look at how gold can become you perfect style option…


Deepika Padukone
Be it a light gold hue sari or maximal style gowns, irrespective of the kind of outfit, it is interesting to see how Deepika Padukone brings out the class in each of them. Make her your style inspiration this festive season.


Rekha
The queen of golden saris, Rekha is known for her bold yet classic look. The actress’ golden sari collection can make any woman go green with envy. If you are a sari person, then this look is your go-to look.



Kangana Ranaut
Here, Kangana opts for a minimal golden touch to her white sari, with the golden gotta patti (or golden cloth strip) across the border, teamed with a gold embroidered pallu. One can also see thin gotta pattis across the length of the sari too, and that adds a touch of class.



Sonam Kapoor Ahuja
Take inspiration from her red-carpet sequin gold floor length gowns or dazzle in a gold lehenga. For her red carpet look, Sonam opted for minimal makeup, while her outfit did all the talking.



Kim Kardashian
When you are looking at cool, gold outfits, you cannot miss out on this style icon. Be it the Met Gala back in 2018 or her latest 40th birthday, Kim Kardashian’s love for the colour is just unmissable. On her birthday, she chose natural makeup and for the Met Gala her look was all about the eyes.


Makeup that you can’t go wrong with, when sporting gold attire

For a natural look
Keep the skin and foundation beautifully matte, while illuminating only the high areas of the face like cheekbones and the T zone. Finish this with washes of taupe eyeshadow on the eye. Focus on lashes and a beautiful hydrated nude lip.
For a look that focuses on the eyes
With a gold outfit, the best option would be to go for smoky eyes that really add to the drama. This Dhanteras and Deepavali, add a twist to your look with colours like shimmery greens, mauves or bronze on the inner corners of your eyelids.
For a look that focuses on the lips
You can play with berry or coral colours that are either dark or light. Keeping your lips matte will highlight the lip, thereby enhancing the shape and colour of your lips. However, when the focus is on the lips, remember not to overdo makeup on the eyes.

Gold is incredibly chic and trendy. It has a rich warmth and timeless appeal that is truly ageless, and gold hues are seemingly everywhere — from the buttons on cardigans to exposed zipper-back dresses. If you’re unsure how to wear gold or wonder if you can even pull it off, the answer is simple — yes, and you can do so with everything! All you need to do is wear it, own it and make it yours. If you are into gold jewellery, pick just one bold piece to complete your look.

"  Nov 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,Transform your living space into a lively and inviting game night hangout,"It is that time of the year, when we all look forward to the fun tittle-tattle over taash and other board games that have become a customary practice during Deepavali and Dhanteras celebrations. Apart from delicious snacks and an assortment of side dishes to up our game night mood, the décor of your game night room also plays an important role in instantly lifting the mood and eventually makes for a picture-perfect get-together space. How do you transform your living space? We let you in on some simple home décor hacks to have you festival ready...
Focus on comfortable seating arrangement
When organising a family get-together, make sure that the seating arrangement is perfect — keeping in mind the long hours of sitting and playing taash or board games. “The seating has to be comfortable and the best option is to opt for floor seating. Use a nice rug or bamboo chatai for floor seating, along with cushions to enliven the space. Use bolster pillows and cushions for proper support. Since such game nights are celebrated with close friends and family over long chats, we need to have a comfortable yet informal seating arrangement that gives a cosy, at-home feel,” says interior designer and stylist Preeti Patnaik. Pune-based home décor instagrammer Alka C Singh adds, “The seating should ideally be on the floor, with thick mattresses along with comfortable back support. You can have white sheets on mattresses, which would provide a perfect backdrop for silk and brocade cushion covers in bright colours or even a bit of bling. Bright bolsters in festive colours definitely give an Indian touch to the setting.”


Put the spotlight on ‘lights’... You heard us! Deepavali is all about lights and your game room should have that element incorporated, in abundance. “The festival of lights comes with the belief that more light and colours mean more joy and happiness for your family and loved ones. Hence, hang a string of lights and flowers to your windows or walls to see the instant change it brings to that space. One can also get creative and make their own paper lanterns and hang them to the ceiling. Make sure you have the element of light in place,” advises Bengaluru-based interior designer Shruthi Acharya.

Give DYI and repurposing a thumbs-up

Got a couple of bright duppattas or saris that you don’t have much use for anymore? “Repurpose or utilise your dupattas to create runners or as a throw on a chair or on a plain sofa to add to the colours. Your old vases can be repurposed to hold cutlery,” says Preeti. Alka too adds, “You do not need to spend a lot on accessorising, just bring out those heavy dupattas and bandhani saris and watch your space transform. You can use bright dupattas and saris as table covers or throws on couches or adorn door and window arches.”

For those of you who are creative and have some extra time on hand, Shruthi suggests, “Let paper lanterns and paper decorations hang from the ceiling.” Another easy way to spruce up your living room is to bring in a couple of beautiful and fresh plants into the space for the day. “A bit of nature within your space is the best way to make a room both fresh and cosy,” says Preeti.


Add an extra edge in your living space décor

Tableware and cutlery: Apart from the right eatables, pay attention to how and what you are serving them in. Use brass, copper, handcrafted ceramic or silverware for snack servings.

Room aroma: Aroma diffusers or the fragrance of agarbattis in the air is always a great idea. Look at the ventilation of the room when placing agarbattis or scented candles in your room."

"  Nov 12, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,4 reasons why cold showers are better,"Nothing feels better than taking a hot shower at the end of a long day.
Hot showers feel relaxing, calming and take away all the stress from you. However, a new study has to say otherwise.

According to a recent study, there is much more that one can gain from a cold shower as compared to a hot shower. Here is the list of benefits of taking a cold shower.
Gives you more energy

If even a cup of coffee can't wake you up in the morning, try taking a cold shower. According to a study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, bathing with cold water stimulates the release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system.

Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that boosts energy, activates your brain, makes you alert and enhances your focusing power.

Boosts your mood

Apart from boosting your energy and increasing your alertness, the neurotransmitter released while taking a cold shower also has a positive effect on your mood. A study published in Medical hypotheses found evidence that bathing with cold water can relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety.

A cold shower sends an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which has an anti-depressive effect.


Pain relief

According to a study published in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences, cold water therapy has proven to reduce pain and inflammation. It also shortens the time body needs to recover after physical activity.


Improves immunity

Right now we need more strong immunity than ever. According to a study published 2016 in the journal PLoS One, people taking cold showers are 29 per cent less likely to fall sick for work and school."

While we take all the precautions, and have intimate family gatherings, Dhanteras-Diwali will always be celebrated in style. Here are a few looks you could try…
Ethnic Enamour
This is the perfect time to celebrate our ethnic roots heirloom classics. Designer Aniket Satam says, “Pick from your Grandmother's treasured sarees and celebrate the rich legacy within your own houses. The dull vintage real zari brocade sarees to pop of bright real Bandhani duppatas. It's time to recycle and reinvent our traditional wardrobes and style them to cherish the warmth of the bygone intimate history of such sentimental pieces.” Designer Shehla Khan adds, “I think the best attire for this Diwali would be a Sharara or a statement sari. A classic outfit worn in your own stylish way is simple chic and effective for every occasion.”


Bold in Gold No gold haul this Diwali? You can still be a golden girl. “Think minimal sparkle with intricate aari, zardosi to gleaming, gota work or badla embroidery for your traditional outfit. Foil prints and Lurex are best for semi-formal choices. If going the traditional route, it's best time to invest in Kanjeevaram or Paithani sarees and support the whole #vocalforlocal,” says Aniket.


Printastic Princess
Designer Shehla Khan says, “Given that we are still facing a pandemic, we can still celebrate in our own small and safe way. I have introduced prints in some bold colours.” Aniket adds “Try Turkish Kilim patterns to traditional Chintz. Prints are a light and most fun way to uplift your wardrobe. Go for traditional patterns in warm palettes or cool kitsch repeats in bright bold quintessential festive contrasts.”

Go for some sunshine
Bathe your festive wardrobe in a bold and bright dosage of sunshine yellow. Add this pop colour of ultimate positivity and bright hope.

DIWALI COLOURS:
Designer Shehla Khan says, “Bright colours such as magenta, purple, raspberry tones fuchsia and pastels like lilac, pink, mustard and of course always white.”


Three style tips for Diwali 2020
i. Remember that it’s the time to celebrate life and togetherness but keeping the circumstances in mind be safe and smart.
ii. Dress up for yourself not others
iii. Bright and bold colours bring joy wherever you are this season .

iv. Indian festive attire need not be sparking or shining to make a statement .

People are getting closer to each other – they now know who their neighbours are, if there are any senior citizens in the building, what are their needs, and so much more.

The flip side of the pandemic is that – musicians are badly affected financially, due to the closure of event venues and no gigs taking place. But looking at the bright side – artistes have started performing online and making videos. There is a lot of original content now. Tiatrists have gone online too. Though online will be a major part of our lives, I only hope it doesn’t wipe out live music. Music is in the soul of every Goan and one cannot ask the government to look into everything. Security environment, infrastructure, crime – these are things that the government should look into; some other things as citizens we can do by ourselves. The government prioritises the Goan folk art forms which are important. As far as other musical events go, the government sponsors and organises events like film festivals, wine festivals, food festivals among others. I’m of the opinion whatever we can, we should. We cannot always depend on the government to do things for us.

15 years ago, fado in Goa was held at a private level. There are efforts made to popularise this art form – a hotel has been organising fado nights for some years now. For the last few years there are classes organised by Fado de Goa and fado competitions are also held. I wouldn’t complain about things not done, there are a lot of people interested in learning the fado. As of now we have had over 400 people of different age groups who have picked up this art form.

I started off my music career 18 years ago, there was a big question mark as to why I was getting into music and in the entertainment field. Music was considered only a pastime or a hobby and not as a profession; today parents are encouraging their kids to take music professionally. It’s now easy to say that you want to be a musician.

We shouldn’t ignore the fact that the pandemic can be a major reason for mental health, depression, mental isolation; this could result in a very negative outlook, but Goa has always been the best. We need to be responsible in terms of managing our garbage, resources, respecting our heritage, history, culture, value of tradition, costume, food, monuments and ruins. There is a lot to learn about Goa and we have to protect and preserve it. We have to get out of the system of pointing fingers – ‘this is not my job!’

To the credit of the makers, the video has been watched by 1.3 million viewers, though the brickbats have come in good measure, with some laughing at the absurdity, while others denouncing the idea of 'promoting such unrealistic shows’. The episode that will air soon on a popular channel shows Titli (played by Madhupriya Choudhury) and her husband Sunny (Aryann Bhowmik) board a plane that then runs into an emergency, after the pilot is taken ill. Titli, who dreamt of becoming a pilot but could not because of her hearing difficulties, takes charge in the cockpit as the ‘autopilot mode of the plane also went kaput’.


Rationalising the scene, the maker and the co-writer of the serial, Sushanta Das, told us, “Titli wanted to be a pilot since she was a child. She read every possible text on how to fly a plane. She has the full knowledge of flying a plane theoretically. Now, in a moment when the flight is about to crash due to the lack of a pilot, she decides to take a chance.” This later also lands her in the eye of a storm, but in the words of Das, ""Miracle happens in our life.” They definitely do on your idiot box."
" Nov 12, 2020, 00:56 IST",,Entertainment,First community fair in Panaji since lockdown,"After a long gap, Panaji saw its first event where several people of all ages got together to celebrate sustainability and co-existence. The first edition of Revival 2020 was held at Garcia Da Orta Garden in Panaji over the weekend and saw several performances over the course of three days.

Local artistes performed diverse sets that included storytelling around the idea of their sustainable lives. Some of these story tellers included Elijah D'Souza and his eco library, Anjee Bhatia and her personal journey of composting and sustainability, Oishorjyo and her journey with sustainable menstruation and Vaishali, who shared her stories of wasteless stores.


While a plethora of musical acts took centre stage, the event also offered a host of other exciting experiences like a bustling flea market that had items right from recycled material to thrift stores, several fun workshops, a vibrant food court and an array of art and craft work. Musician Varun Carvalho and the Rise Nation Army also took to the stage and had the crowd grooving endlessly! Musicians Maria and Neil were also present on the final day and performed some soulful Portuguese music that had the entire crowd captivated. Other acts included Baul Madhu Sudan, Manuka, Goa Hip Hop Projekt, Aviv Pereira, Prashant Edwin as well as Capoeira performers who had a lot of moves in them and ensured the crowd joined them as well!

The musicians ensured the crowd was on its feet. The venue was bustling with people, young and old having a gala time with their friends and families while also being cautious about their hygiene and sanitisation. Children were seen dancing alongside their parents while many others relaxed at the tables and enjoyed their food and the music.

On the final night, Gabriella and Sreeja also addressed the crowd about the current Mollem issue that the people of Goa continue to fight against. They highlighted currently happening and how people could volunteer their skills and resources to help the campaign. Speaking to Goa Times, Gabriella, a marine conservationist says, “Revival 2020 was a great way to get people engaging with the idea of sustainability and zero waste and see how we as citizens can look into our lifestyles and make changes"".

“I really enjoyed the food and music here. It was also a nice break since I had not been anywhere since March. It felt great to be out and I was quite relieved that people were also cautious about their personal hygiene, ” says Daniel Rodrigues who travelled from Margao to the event.

Ati Aier, from the exotic Naga cuisine stall, says, “It was great exposure since I have a small home business. People were quite enthusiastic about the Naga food I served and were enjoying it! The aura of the place was also lovely!”"

"  Nov 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Deepavali celebrations have been a multicultural affair for me: Malavika Mohanan,"For Malavika Mohanan, this Deepavali is all about new beginnings. The actress is all set to ring in the festival with her family at their new home in Mumbai, and that, for her, is the best way to celebrate. “It has been quite hectic for the last few days — packing, shifting, and cleaning. It has been a task, shifting houses during the pandemic. But there’s also a lot of excitement. This year, Deepavali is going to be in our new place and I feel this is the nicest beginning,” Malavika tells us.

The actress has been busy doing up their new home. “As a family, we have a very earthy taste. We are using Athangudi tiles for the whole house, and have infused elements of a typical Malayali household. While my parents are doing up the house the traditional way, my room will reflect my choices and taste,” she says.


Growing up in Mumbai, Deepavali celebrations have been a multicultural affair, says Malavika. “I’ve friends who belong to various regions and I used to spend the whole day house-hopping and celebrating with them. I’d go to my Maharashtrian friend’s place to eat and have the tastiest delicacies ever. I used to help my Gujarati friend with the rangoli. I am a very arts-and-crafts type of person and love doing rangoli. As a child, I used to buy simple, brown diyas and paint and decorate them according to my imagination. I haven’t had time to do it in the past few years and I miss that,” she adds.

So, will this Deepavali be all about lighting lamps or bursting crackers for her? “I was the kind who used to light up crackers,” she says with a laugh, “While my friends would go for flower pots, I used to like bombs and rockets and that 1000walas. But I stopped bursting crackers almost seven years ago. I think it was more to do with celebrating Deepavali sustainably. Also, for me, the festival was all about spending a lot of time with family and friends. This year, my brother is also at home.But we can’t fly down to Kerala to visit my grandparents, who live there. So, it’s just going to be us. We will be performing Lakshmi Puja on the main day. And also have some great food. Eat, pray, love… these are crucial parts of celebration this year.”


There was a buzz that the makers of her Master — starring Vijay and directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj — are releasing the film’s teaser on Deepavali. “I really can’t say anything about it. Like everyone else; I was looking forward to catching the film this summer. But the pandemic happened and our priorities changed. Now, theatres have started opening across the country and that’s great news. The Master team knows when it will be the right time to release details about the film. I feel it should be when things get safer for people to come into theatres and experience the film.”

"  Nov 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,"With big releases being held back, opening of single-screen theatres in the state remains uncertain","Karnataka’s single-screen theatres have been shut for the past seven months leading to loss of revenue of over `300 crore. When permissions were granted to resume cinema exhibition at the end of the lockdown, some single-screens opened their doors, only to shut them just as soon, owing to few footfalls. The majority, though, are caught in the deadlock between producers and service producers over reduction in virtual print fee, which has become a hindrance for the release of new films. The stakeholders were hoping that the issue would be resolved by October 15, which did not happen. Exhibitors reluctant to screen old films
The Karnataka Film Exhibitors Association decided not to open single-screen theatres as no new films are being released. They are reluctant to screen the current available lot, as most of the films have either aired on television or on OTT platforms.
“Producers are not willing to release new films, especially big-ticket movies. A few relatively smaller films have been released, but there is no continuity in the stream of flow of new films to keep theatres operational,” says the president of the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce, D R Jairaj. Screenings of re-released films like Gentleman, Tagaru, Shivaji Surathkal, Dia and Love Mocktail continue in multiplexes.

New films to release by end of 2020 or early 2021
The stakeholders are now banking on star films like Kotigobba 3, Roberrt, Yuvarathnaa, Pogaru and Salaga to bring people back to theatres. With release dates not fixed, these films are likely to hit screens only by the fag end of the year or early 2

Stakeholders want tax waivers

At a meeting held in a theatre in Mysuru, a group of theatre owners put forth various demands, including waiving off property tax in the current financial year and uniformity in collecting property taxes across Karnataka to overcome the financial loss. They are also seeking reduction in the license renewal fee.

President of Mysore Theatre Owners Association, MR Rajaram, says, “We are glad that permission has been given to open theatres, but issues like property taxes, which varies from one city to another, need to be addressed. We are seeking exemption from property taxes this year.”


Here’s why single-screen movie halls remain shut

Karnataka government allows cinema halls and multiplexes to open with 50% seating capacity on October 15, provided safety protocols are followed.
Multiplexes across Karnataka open for cine goers after a break of seven months. In Mysuru, ticket prices are reduced to `70 and `100 to attract film buffs. While a fraction of single-screen halls in Bengaluru also opened, lukewarm audience response, overhead costs and uncertainty about new releases led most to shut operations again.
The Karnataka Film Exhibitors Association decides not to open theatres as no new major films are being released. The ones being re-released in multiplexes have had theatrical runs, as well as TV or OTT platform outings.
On October 25, Duniya Vijay and his Salaga team watch Tagaru in a theatre to instill confidence among people to go back to cinema halls."

This also means ensuring our furry friends aren’t left behind. It is no surprise then that this Deepavali gives pet parents options aplenty when it comes to ensuring their children have a swell time along with them. Ganesh Ramani, country head, MARS Petcare, reveals, “The demand for pet products is now much more than what the normal used to be pre-COVID. I would attribute this to the fact that pet parents have spent a lot more time with their pets during the lockdown and work from home phases, which has led parents to indulge them with a lot of products. Additionally, a lot more people, especially those who live alone, have adopted pets over the last few months. This Diwali will obviously see more parents buying treats for them.”


Clothing options aplenty
Many designers, both veterans and young, have forayed into specialised pet outfits on order. “We love to upload special pictures on social media during times of celebration. Why leave our dogs behind. A coordinated outfit for the pets – even a scarf or a waistcoat – can make all the difference,” says actress Aindrita Ray.
A cool hamper for the pets
Ishmeet Singh Chandiok, founder of Harley’s Corner, says gift hampers curated specially for furry babies and their parents are in demand this Diwali. “The hamper consists of Chicken Paw-Cakes with activated charcoal to aid in your pet’s digestion, a salt free chicken broth with herbs and chicken and a packet of protein packed Munchies which aid in dental hygiene as well. These are some of the goodies you can gift your pooches so they go wagging their tails and enjoy the festivities as much as you do,” he says.

Gift them a holiday

Many pet parents look at heading out of the city to stay away from the noise and pollution during Diwali.

Of late, with a lot more resorts and holiday destinations becoming pet friendly, there are more reasons to take your pet along, on that short or long vacation.


Indulge them with treats such as cakes, doughnuts and ice cream, too

Many specialised services offer treats for dogs, which include cakes, ice cream, waffles, doughnuts and more. “Discerning pet parents, who treat their pets as their children, study what is good for them. Now, a lot of people are not just buying cakes and other desserts for their own pets, but also giving them out as gifts to friends who are pet parents. During festivals, the focus often shifts away from pets to family and friends. To ensure they do not feel left out, a few gifts for them are thoughtful,” says Ishmeet.


A spa day for your petActress Parul Yadav says that she loves to gift her ‘son’ Pluto treats. Treats could include things like a day out in the park or at the spa. “We love to pamper ourselves every now and then, so why not gift our babies a day out in the spa and make them feel special.

" Nov 13, 2020, 16:23 IST",Sruthi Raman,Lifestyle,"#SustainableFashion: This Deepavali, go vegan with your silk choice","Deepavali is that time of the year when you flaunt your traditional wardrobe in all its finery. What if you could turn over a sustainable new leaf this festive season by giving your wardrobe a vegan twist?
With veganism having found its way into the world of fashion, sustainable fashion is anything but a new phenomenon. But the alternative silk sari is seeing a massive boom this year, say conscious entrepreneurs. Meenu of Shubam Sarees, a Chennai-based vegan line, she co-founded with her husband Arvind, says that she has seen a record number of sales during these last couple of months, not just from her vegan clientele, but also from regular customers.

“The saris that we sell are made out of rayon and cotton, but are processed in a way that it gets the sheen of a silk sari. All our saris are handmade by the weavers of Tamil Nadu,” she notes. While the vegans are happy to wear a cruelty-free sari, the non-vegans are happy to flaunt a silk sari that is not heavy on their pocket, making it a win-win situation, Meenu explains, adding, “All these saris have the traditional Kanjeevaram motifs and designs, which makes it easier for customers to make the switch.”
Vegan silk has different types of variants. The Ahimsa silk is one of the most popular variants, wherein the fabric is made without killing silkworms. And a pioneer of this technique is Kusuma Rajaiah. The Hyderabad-based handloom technologist, who is credited with the invention of the Ahima Silk, adds that the popularity of vegan fashion and silk, in particular, has soared due to consciousness. Apart from curious customers, international fashion brands, too, are becoming extremely inclusive, he adds.

Eri silk is yet another eco-friendly variant, which is popular among vegan fashion designers worldwide. Avni Aggarwal of sustainable line Sundarii Handmade is overwhelmed with the response for her Ajrakh Eri silk collections and adds that customer awareness is the need of the hour. “There is a long road ahead to educate the masses about sustainable fashion and its long-term benefits. Shoppers who have a taste for subtle and classy handmade saris are well aware of the vegan silk,” Avni observes, adding that slow fashion saris are the way forward.

“You may end up not only buying a six-yard piece of fabric for yourself, but you will be helping a lot of people in the ecosystem, right from the weaver who has woven the sari and the artisan who has hand-block printed the fabric, to the dyers, washers, and environment at large,” she adds.

How is an Ahimsa Silk sari produced?


In the Ahimsa Silk model, the silk moths are allowed to pierce the cocoon and come out naturally. “We will extract the silk from pierced/broken cocoons by way of spinning. In this process, about 25 litres of water will be used for degumming to get 1kg of yarn. And this water will be reused after treatment (with the ETP Plant). This is purely made by following the Ahimsa path, so it is Ahimsa Silk,” explains Kusuma.


Vegan fashion


The global vegan women’s fashion market size was valued at USD 396.3 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2020 to 2027.

" Nov 14, 2020, 13:41 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Lifestyle,Deepavali gifting gets a healthy twist now,"This Deepavali, it is health that gains spotlight over the glitter and glitz associated with Dhanteras shopping, especially because of the pandemic. The COVID-19 scare has led to wellness and a healthy lifestyle taking precedence over the usual gifting. Here’re some wellness ideas to look at if you want to be a part of this thoughtful and growing trend.

Fitness trackers, gym equipmentFitness expert Wanitha Ashok calls this the expression of true love. “I think focusing on health is the ideal way of showing our love to the people we care about. With the pandemic still looming large over our heads, people are worried about stepping out. Everyone clocks in less than 2,000 steps daily, which is way below the required number for good health. Fitness trackers, especially those with oximeters, are good gifts during these times. They are trendy to flaunt too. Even vouchers to buy fitness equipment for one’s home, are great gifts,” she says.


Nuts, granola and superfoodDitching those sweet hampers and instead sending boxes of nuts, healthy seeds and superfoods with the right nutrients, is a great gifting idea for loved ones and employees. “Gift boxes of sweets are perishable and aren’t good for health. We can instead look at gifting nuts and superfoods, which have a longer shelf life and help in weight loss too,” points out Wanitha.
Healing crystals for the mind, body and soul

Crystals are already in vogue, what with celebrities like Megan Fox, Uma Thurman and Gisele Bundchen swearing by them. They also make for great gifting options, as they are known to help people deal with anything from workplace anxiety to the stress caused by the ongoing pandemic. “Crystals are quite a popular choice among metaphysical stones, as the calmness and courage, and energy associated with them, are in high demand. They address anxiety, depression, adaptability, focus, emotional well-being and determination,” says healer and wellness coach Kuhoo Gupta.
What would make for a must-have gift for adults who are working from home in the pandemic? “Never undermine the power of good books, they are the best quarantreats during the festive season amid the lockdown. Books make an ideal lockdown festive gift as they can provide the essential escape from the monotonous routines of quarantine, by transporting readers to far-off lands, where exciting adventures and endearing characters await. Also, sending a book sends the message that you care. Books are currently seen as a popular choice symbolising intimacy, connectedness and unfathomable value of time. In fact, many non-readers have discovered their love for reading during the pandemic,” says life purpose coach Payal Sagar.
Return to roots with ayurvedaVishal Kaushik, Founder and MD of Upakarma Ayurveda, says, “The concept of gifting in 2020 has transformed. Ayurveda has already been considered to be one of the greatest gifts for mankind, and it has evolved a lot since inception. People across all age groups are now turning towards Ayurveda products which come with a contemporary twist. During the pandemic, we have witnessed a dramatic surge in sales as people are waking up to the idea of self-care. As the trend is set to continue, we are seeing an increase in demand for curated gifts for physical as well as mental wellbeing.”

The sound of wellnessAn interesting gifting option for people during Deepavali, is a wellness playlist. From guided meditation playlists to sounds that soothe the mind and even audio books that motivate or de-stress – they can be good gifts for friends who are always on the run. For those who like their gym, zumba and yoga sessions, personalized playlists for their workout sessions can be a great gift in this time of social distancing and quirky gifting.Other interesting ‘wellness’ gifting options...l Electric back and body massage tools: If electric massagers are beyond your budget, opt for body massage wands or rolling pins that help increase blood supply and reduce pain and inflammation.

l Computer eye glasses with UV protection: Having to deal with prolonged hours on our smartphones and laptops during WFH, these make great gifts for those who are in such a space and situation.

Iravan is being helmed by debutant Ram Ranga, who has worked on many films as an associate. It also stars Adhvithi Shetty and Vivek. ""The film revolves around three main characters. Iravan is the name of Arjuna's son in Mahabharata. He was a pivotal character in the war, but not much is known about him. Another meaning of Iravan is the person who has defeated the sea.

The best part is that Diwali is all about cheat meals! My Diwali will have simple things, some rituals like puja and lighting the diyas. This Diwali, more than ever, I am looking forward to family time since 2020 has been a tough year. So, I want to be around family members and express gratitude for being with loved ones.” Practicing meditation since long, Ihana says it helped lessen the impact of the pandemic on her mind “We have to understand that depression is a disease that requires medical attention. That said, practices like yoga and meditation which work on your mind, strengthen the person from within and can help mitigate effects of crisis. Many colleagues in entertainment industry realised its importance in the lockdown.

Since theatres were shuttered, most filmmakers have adopted the wait and watch strategy before considering OTT release. “Punjabi films will also release on OTT but not before January since people want to see which way the situation goes till then.

"  Nov 13, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,"Exclusive: People are bound to make judgements without hearing the other side of the story, says Vijay Raaz","Bombay Times Exclusive
“I am all for an investigation by the authorities. However, to ostracise me, suspend and terminate my services from my forthcoming films even before any sort of investigation, is shocking. I have no words to express”

Last week, actor Vijay Raaz was accused of molestation by a female crew member of their upcoming film Sherni. The shoot of the film starring Vidya Balan had resumed a few days back in Balaghat (Madhya Pradesh) after the long break owing to the pandemic. The cast and crew of the film was staying at a hotel in Gondia, a few kilometres away from the shooting location. Vijay Raaz was arrested by the Gondia police late night on November 2 and was released on conditional bail by a local court the next afternoon. Right after the incident, the actor returned to Mumbai as he received an email dated Nov 3, 2020, from the film’s makers Abundantia Entertainment Pvt Ltd, stating his temporary suspension from the film due to the complaint received. The producers have even set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to probe the molestation allegations against Raaz.
So far, Raaz hasn’t commented on the matter, but when Bombay Times reached out to him, after much deliberation, he opened up on the allegations against him. He said, “Women’s safety is of prime concern. I have a 21-year-old daughter, so I understand the gravity of the situation. I am all for an investigation by the authorities. However, to ostracise me, suspend and terminate my services from my forthcoming films even before any sort of investigation, is shocking. I have no words to express. It’s a very dangerous place to be in. I have been working in the film industry for 23 years!


Bohot mehnat se maine apna career banaya hai. Tinka tinka jodke maine apna ghar banaya hai. Anybody can sabotage anyone’s career? Kisine bol diya aur aapne maan liya that I am a harasser? People are bound to make judgements without hearing the other side of the story. No matter what the outcome of this case, aap pe ek thappa lag jaata hai. I have been pronounced guilty even before the investigation. My right to earn a livelihood is badly affected. Am I not the victim here? My old father who lives in Delhi, also has to face the society and so does my young daughter.”

Bombay Times reached out to a unit member who was apparently present during the shoot at all times, but she refused to divulge details saying that the matter was sub judice. She briefly said, “We have said what we had to say. Everything has been told to the police. Law will take its course and people should get justice irrespective of their gender.”

According to sources, the complainant has reported in her FIR that she felt uncomfortable on various occasions between October 25 and 29. The source also added that Raaz putting his hand around her shoulder and touching her hair didn’t go down well with her and when he was informed of her discomfort, he immediately apologised.

Raaz added, “I have been working with the same crew for over a year. We play cricket on set. It’s how we are with each other. Yet, when I was told she felt uncomfortable, I apologised. This was in front of the entire crew. My apology meant I respect your feelings. But it didn’t mean that I acknowledged the claims made later at the police station. Saying sorry doesn’t always mean that you are wrong. It means you respect someone’s feelings more. I also have responsibilities and I need a job. Mere itney saalon ki mehnat can go down the drain if people jump to conclusions without verifying the claims. This should not be one-sided. Truth prevails but the damage is done.”


Lawyer speaks


Vijay Raaz’s lawyer Advocate Saveena Bedi Sachar told Bombay Times, “It has become essential to clarify Mr. Vijay Raaz’s stand on the allegations levied on him, as being an actor and a public figure he has suffered in an unprecedented manner with implications and consequences which is irreversible and all this for an alleged offense which he strongly believes he has not committed.


Mr. Vijay Raaz has not been accused of any non-bailable offence and his right to claim bail was absolute and in such cases even the Hon’ble Court ensures bail, as was rightly granted to our client. He is also surprised that a courteous apology which he may have given in the heat of the moment without batting an eyelid or giving it a second thought, as he never had any malice or bad intentions towards the complainant, could be used against him. The Hon’ble Court has the right to decide, but unfortunately, in these times, employers often fear outrage on social media and act impulsively, by terminating contracts, and while social media outrage has its place in society, our client has no such antecedents against him.



It is sad that some big companies fail to understand the importance of having a balanced enquiry and impose sanctions on the accused under the pretext of 'zero tolerance' even before the investigation starts. POSH should not be used as a cover to deny men their right to justice. Indian law recognizes ‘presumption of innocence’ and as a presumably innocent person my client is entitled to earn his livelihood and that cannot be taken away from him on the basis of a pending investigation. Mr Vijay Raaz maintains that he never had any wrong intentions towards anyone on the set or anyone associated with the film. The matter is pending investigation and Mr. Raaz will provide applicable proofs in the Hon'ble Court and that he fully trusts and believes that the judicial system of our country will ensure justice for him.”"

The woman with the million-dollar smile, Madhuri Dixit Nene is all excited as she goes down the memory lane and shares fond memories of the festival with us.


Back to filming her upcoming project, Madhuri spoke to Bombay Times amidst her shoot. She said, “My kids have grown up now. They are environment conscious, so they don’t burst crackers, but when we moved back here from the US, for the first two years, the kids were enthusiastic about firecrackers. Now we celebrate Diwali in other ways. We light diyas and I love doing Laxmi puja. That is one thing we never miss out on.”


The scrumptious Diwali delicacies is another favourite. Madhuri revealed, “I love the Diwali faraal and shankarpali is my favourite! They are delicious... sweet and salty, which is why I like them the most. When we were growing up, my mom used to make everything at home — the typical Maharashtrian Diwali cuisine (faraal) — chatpata chaklis, karanji, kaju katli, besan and ravyache laadu, shankarpali and motichur laadus. We were her helpers. I used to enjoy making chakklis with the saacha and then frying them. It was an opportunity for moms to teach kids how to make stuff, how to welcome people at home, be good hosts and good guests when you visit other homes. It’s a part of our social behaviour.”
The actress stresses on how this festival reminds us of our Indian tradition and culture. She elaborated, “Diwali signifies celebration; it's a time when families come together, which is a part of our Indian culture. It’s also an occasion to wear festive clothes and mingle with friends, which is not possible this year, so we will catch up with each other on video conferences. This year as we are celebrating Diwali and Children’s Day together, and we at Dance with Madhuri have decided to celebrate and spread the joy of dancing with some underprivileged children in Mumbai. We will be hosting a dance workshop for over 70 kids at St. Catherine’s Home.”"

The couple got to spend ample time together with their two kids and this Deepavali will also be all about being with the family. “Luckily for us, Yash will resume shooting only after the festival, so there will be a lot of celebration at home for us. The plan is to decorate the house with lights and enjoy a meal together as a family with all our favourite treats,” reveals Radhika about their festival plans. The family has also just returned from Goa, where they celebrated their son Yatharv’s first birthday. The video shared by the couple has gone viral. “We had booked an entire entertainment park in Bengaluru and had a carnival theme for Ayra’s first birthday. So, we wanted to do something big for Yatharv’s first birthday too, as it is a special occasion. The pandemic, though, did not allow us to go ahead with the grand plans that we originally had,” says Radhika.

The celebrations on the yacht, though, seem picture perfect. Who came up with the blue and white yacht party idea? “We were brainstorming and I suggested that we should have a pirate theme party. Yash was on board but said that we had to do it by the sea. Eventually, the pirate theme did not work out, but it was in Goa, which is very special to both of us. To be in sync with the sea, we chose the tropical colours of blue and white. We had our closest family and friends in attendance. Of course, we ensured everything was done with precautions, right from us driving to Goa to ensuring the yacht was sanitised,” says Radhika.

Ayra, adds Radhika, enjoyed the party most. “She is a water baby just like me. She loves the beach and the pool. She made the most of this trip outside town,” she says."

This reuniting of loved ones holds a special place in her heart.


Sonam says, “For me, Diwali and festivals at large have always been about bonding with my family and close set of friends. There’s something so beautiful about these celebrations when you spend it with people who matter to you.

It is beautiful, traditional, and yet, so modern. It’s always fun to experiment with a gold piece especially with western looks, that’s something I personally love doing. One can pair a gold necklace with a classic LBD, it really never goes out of style. Otherwise, a white shirt and blue denims layered with nice jewellery looks really chic. It looks great with a pant suit and a nice Indo-western outfit as well.”"

Their maternity wardrobe was nothing short of glam. Whether it was a casual day out or dressing up for an occasion, these actresses had us envious with their maternity looks. With the festive season upon us, here’s a look at some would-be-mommies who are setting fashion goals and their wardrobe is yet again an inspiration for all moms-to-be this festive season...

Kareen Kapoor Khan

During her first pregnancy, Kareena slayed in every outfit. All eyes are on the fashion diva yet again as she is expecting her second child. The actress, who has been working through her second pregnancy, was recently seen in a pink floor length dress (above), which got a
thumbs-up from everyone.

Anita Hassanandani
The television star surprised everyone with news of her pregnancy recently. And her sense of fashion during her pregnancy, with flowy dresses, has made quite an impression since. Take a leaf out of her fashion album with her satin top and pants that work wonders for the festive season.


Katy Perry
New mom Katy Perry was seen making appearances on talk shows and red-carpet events in long flowy gowns, in floral prints (below) or solid colours like silver (right) through her pregnancy. Add these bursts of colour to your outfits and make a statement.


Emma Roberts

The actress made her pregnancy announcement in a chic, white full-length gown. However, flowy dresses and gowns seem to be Emma’s choice of go-to maternity wear. The actress has been seen on talk shows wearing floral printed or solid coloured gowns, sans jewellery.



Anushka Sharma

Anushka made her pregnancy announcement flaunting her baby bump in a black polka dot dress. Post that, she’s been seen making appearances at husband Virat Kohli’s matches, and has since, set the fashion registers for would-be-moms soaring. Take inspiration from her floral print dresses or solid colour dresses, which she usually pairs with large hoop earrings, for this festive season."
"  Nov 13, 2020, 01:00 IST",Ismat Tahseen,Lifestyle,"Shine on in shimmer, like these Bollywood stars","The festival of Diwali has kicked off with Dhanteras today. Since gold is an important part of the celebration, it is not just limited to investing in the yellow metal, but is also a quintessential part of the festive attire — right from the outfits to the accessories. The current trend includes metallic hues like silver and rose gold that can create the right glitz and drama, too. However, if you’re hesitant about going wrong with the metallic sheen, take a cue from the Bollywood stars, who’ve rocked sequins and sparkles in these shades on their gorgeous saris, flowy cocktail gowns, mini dresses, embellished cholis and lehengas, off-shoulder outfits and more as they flit between the risqué and demure in it...


Say it with sequins



Sequins shimmer like none other during this time. Merged with pastels or mirrors, sequins on a sari, lehenga or even a dress is the stand-out trend, so it’s no wonder that Bollywood actresses often choose to dazzle in them. Kareena Kapoor Khan loves the embellishment and has carried it off in style on numerous occasions. Recently, she chose a sequin gold-and-mirror sari for a wedding reception. Fashion pundits will also not forget Sonam K Ahuja’s sequin-embellished cream and gold couture gown. Rakul Preet Singh also scorched things up with her sequinned silver figure-hugging dress that was cinched at the waist and so did Kiara Advani in her fitting gold gown with a plunging neckline.

Making a blouse impact



Katrina Kaif, clearly a queen of sequins, has gone high-glam in sequins on a jumpsuit and a pantsuit. She has also worn an unconventional sequinned blouse with exaggerated sleeves to go with her A-line lehenga. Jacqueline Fernandez oozed oomph in her golden-yellow sequinned sari that she paired with a silver sequinned blouse designed with a singlet-sleeve. She aced the drape with minimal make-up, golden earrings and a high ponytail. Ananya Panday made a case for warm-toned sequins as she rocked an embellished bralette and full gold lehenga with beads and crystals in a wave pattern.


Waltzing with black



If you’re wondering whether a dark hue can make for a match with gold, take a cue from Shilpa Shetty Kundra, who stunned in her golden and black sequinned shimmer gown an an awards night. Deepika Padukone also channelled elegance in her strappy blouse with an embellished lehenga skirt with a sheer dupatta.

The trend can be worn with any attire:
Sari
Pencil skirt
Mini skirt
Lehenga-choli
Short jacket
Cocktail gown
Pantsuit

Designer speak
Whether to a party, wedding or another festive occasion, a sequinned outfit can effortlessly get to you there. And they get the nod from top designers, too. Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla have always rooted for sequins. They share, “Sequins are universal, their use is neither restricted by fabrics or silhouettes. We have used sequins from the beginning of our design history and continue to use them with gusto 35 years later. They are at times the ‘main event’ in an ensemble or an accent used to add shine and highlight hallmark embroidery techniques like resham, chikankari, zardozi and mirrorwork. Sequins add bling, light, glamour and playfulness to an ensemble. Be it an Indian traditional silhouette — western wear or fusion sequins belong everywhere.”

Quite a few stars have worn the gold sequinned-look in saris and Indo-western outfits. Designer Shehla Khan reveals that these outfits are beautiful year-end festive favourites. “Everyone is reminiscing about the ‘70s and ‘90s fashion trends and the glitz and glamour from those decades. We use inspiration from these times to create designs for the Indian festive season. Sequins enhance any embroidery in terms of sparkles, it is also the easiest and best way to add a touch of glamour to any kind of embroidery,” she says. However, the designer has some fashion tips for acing this look. “Sequin-sheeted outfits are a statement in themselves, so, I believe it’s important not to accessorise too much as it becomes an overkill. Also, I’d pair the look with some smokey nude make-up and a classic pair of heels to finish,” she adds.

How to pull off a sequinned look

- This is a high-shine look already, so keep the make-up minimal

- If you are wearing it during the day, opt for a softer look with muted gold or pastels

- A sequinned jacket pairs well with your denim jeans and a white shirt or top.

- Wearing a sequinned mini skirt? Keep the footwear black or nude to avoid looking like a disco ball.

- A plain fringe skirt also goes well with a sparkly top."
"  Nov 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,I sing Chiranjeevi’s songs as lullabies to our son: Meghana Raj Sarja,"Three weeks after the birth of her son, Meghana Raj Sarja addressed the media in her first press conference since her husband Chiranjeevi Sarja's untimely passing. This was on the joyous occasion of the cradle ceremony of her son that was held at her parents' home. The unique cradle, which is supposed to be worth around Rs 1 lakh, has been crafted especially for her by artisans in Dharwad and has artwork including images of young Lord Krishna.
Speaking to Bangalore Times on the sidelines of the event, Meghana spoke about the joys and bittersweet moments of motherhood.

‘I now realise that motherhood is the toughest job’
I have realised that this is the most wonderful and toughest job on earth. People have rightly said that one does not understand the worth of a mother's love and sacrifices until you experience it yourself. I salute my mother for all that she has done. She still continues to be my biggest strength. There have been times when I have been at my lowest during my pregnancy and my mother was there with me, every step of the way, filling me with strength. People say I am brave, but only my mother has seen me in my weakest moments.

On Chiranjeevi ‘returning like a phoenix’

I'd mentioned earlier that Chiru used to tell me that he was like a phoenix bird and I see that in my son. Everyone who has seen my son so far has said that he is a photocopy of Chiru, which I agree. Chiru has always been about celebration in life and I want my son to be just like that. I want him to be just like Chiru, who was celebrated by fans for the person that he was. I will work towards imbibing those qualities in him.

‘I will be the best mother to my son’

I am going to give my son my everything. He is my biggest source of strength. I see happiness when I look at his face. He motivates me to be the best parent for him. When it comes to taking on the dual roles as a single parent, I don't know whether I will be a good father to him, but I will be the best mother to him.

‘I call my son Babyma, while my dad calls him Chintu’

I am yet to fix a permanent pet name for my son. I call him by many terms of endearment. The one that comes to my mind the most whenever I see him is Babyma. My father has named him Chintu. Initially, I wondered why, but my father explained that he thinks that Chintu means the one who will take away all the Chinte (worries) from our lives. A lot of people at home now call him Chintu. We will have a big naming ceremony shortly, which will be held on the muhurta chosen by the elders. We have been given a letter with which the name should begin, but we haven't narrowed down on anything. I know fans have been suggesting many names.

Chiru's songs are lullabies now

I sing to my son often, especially as lullabies when he needs to sleep. Most of my song choices are from Chiru's films. One that I sing often is Ille Ile Ello from Chiru.


‘I will return to acting’


Right now, my son is my priority, as he is very young. But I will definitely return in front of the camera. Cinema is all that I know and what my family knows. Just like how motherhood doesn't put a stop to any other working professional's career, the same would be the case with me.


Meghana speaks about artworks depicting the late Chiranjeevi with their son

It feels great to see so much of love in the form of artwork, be it from Karan Acharya or anyone else. These works are beautiful. There is a bittersweet feeling too, as I wish those pictures of Chiru by my baby's and my side was real."
"  Nov 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Entertainment,L Subramaniam and Bindu's next track is about facing darkness and coming out of it,"Ahead of the video release of her next track, When It's Dark, singer Bindu Subramaniam says that it is very special to her. The track, which she has worked on along with her father, musician Dr L Subramaniam, is a part of the latter's global fusion project, Beyond Borders. She says, ""This is my dad's magnum opus. It's his dream project which he's been working on and has roped in some of his closest jazz musician friends like Stephane Grappelli, George Duke, Larry Coryell, and more.""

Bindu, who has sung three tracks from the album, tells us more about the track. ""I co-wrote this song with my father when I was in Berklee College of Music. It's funny that the release is on November 14, on Deepavali, and the song is called When It's Dark. However, what I'm excited about is that the video, which features my father, was shot in my house recently, and this was the first time that he had left his house, since February this year, after he came back from Australia. To get him to come out of his house was a big thing. It's also special for me because my home is my sanctuary and to shoot this song with the Deepavali theme was really nice,"" says Bindu.


Talking about the track, L Subramaniam says, ""The song is about darkness and coming out of it. It seems apt in today's time given the situation we are all in. It was nice working with Bindu on this song. We have worked on it for a long time. I have played the piano for the song and it is the first time I am playing for her track. She has sung beautifully. Because different musicians have worked on this video, it was mixed in Poland, mastered in Los Angeles and shot in Bengaluru.""

Bindu adds that it's not just the track, but the whole album that's special to her. ""I feel very happy when I see the way this album has shaped up, because I grew up listening to it. The album has been in the works for that long and some of the songs from it have been the sound tracks to my childhood, especially the ones I've not been a part of,"" says Bindu, adding,""Every song in the album has a story. There is a song called Lullaby, which my father worked on with maa (Kavita Krishnamurti). She sung it and it has a very traditional lyric in terms of lullabies and the response of a child has been brought out through a blues harmonica. It's a global fusion album with jazz as the backbone. But the storytelling part of it - which has been done by my father - adds the Indian elements."""

The movie, which will be an action-comedy, is being planned as a summer release.
A source says, “Kannan and Santhanam had associated with each other for a lot of films, and the actor played the lead in the filmmaker’s latest release.

"  Nov 14, 2020, 00:00 IST",Prathibha Joy,Entertainment,Sudeep's personal interest in the making of Phantom gets Alankar Pandian to collaborate as co-producer,"The business of cinema is not new to filmmaker Alankar Pandian. His extended family has been in the making and distribution of Tamil cinema for years, so, it was no wonder that he too found a calling in it about four years ago, when he launched Dubai-based Invenio Origin and its production arm Invenio Films India in Bengaluru. After dabbling with Tamil cinema, Alankar thought it prudent to extend his business venture into Kannada films as well, as his tribute to his years in Bengaluru.

Sandalwood, he says, was new to him, so he began on a modest note with the PC Shekar-directed The Terrorist (2018), which went head-to-head with The Villain at the box office and didn’t reap benefits. Unperturbed, Alankar saw it as a learning curve and for his next venture, decided to step it up and partnered on the Shivarajkumar-starrer, Ayushmanbhava (2019).


“Invenio Films India has a history of marketing and distributing the best Tamil cinema to the world, an expertise that I wanted to bring to Kannada films as well and help them reach their full potential as far as a global audience goes. We are also looking at strengthening the Kannada film industry by helping with the digital rights, especially for the foreign market,"" says Alankar, adding that the focus of the firm is to support the making of good content.

As a massive step in that direction, he has now partnered with Manjunath Gowda’s Shalini Arts in the making of one of Kannada cinema’s most anticipated projects, the Sudeep-starrer, Phantom. “A collaboration with Sudeep was something I wanted and I was, in fact, in conversation with Manjunath about this. The fact that the team went ahead and started shooting amid the pandemic was proof that this project meant a lot to them. Along the way, I got to meet them in Hyderabad, and saw first-hand, the dedication that is going into the making, especially Sudeep, who is taking a personal interest in every tiny detail of the film. It just seemed the perfect film to be a part of,” explains Alankar.


The scale and the scope of Phantom, which is being made for a multi-language release excites Alankar, and while he hopes to be able to give Kannada cinema more such projects, content, he says, will be the deciding factor. “I will continue to make Kannada films across budget ranges. So, while I will be on board Phantom, I will also back Shekar’s next, which is relatively more modest.,” he adds.


In ensuring that good content from the south gets a wider audience, Invenio Films has also tied up with Mumbai-based Echelon Productions. “We are currently committed to remake the Tamil film Aadai and the Kannada movie The Terrorist in Hindi,” he signs off."

""This is my first venture as an actor. I had earlier done a very minor part in Gudugudiya Sedi Nodo, in which I played a tribal soothsayer. The Rose Villa is my big break in films,"" she says.

In the film, Archana and Raja Raveendar play an elderly couple who stay at a villa on the outskirts of the city.

It was great to learn from him about certain nuances of filmmaking,"" she adds.



As a dancer and theatre actor, how was the experience of working in front of the camera? ""Acting was easy, but the real challenge for me was to understand the technicalities like looking at the camera and which one to look at and when. But I picked it up soon enough. Also, Dheekshith and Raja sir helped me and gave me tips all along. It was a huge learning for me,"" says Archana."

In fact, the entire cast and crew are going to be shooting so that the schedule can be wrapped as planned by next week.

Niti Taylor: 'I am super excited because this is my first Diwali after marriage'



I am super excited because this is my first Diwali after marriage. We have shifted to new house in Ahmedabad and I have decorated it so well. My in-laws are coming for Diwali and we are looking forward to spending some good time with each other. When you stay away from your family, you realise their worth and want to spend as much time with them as possible. My menu is ready and I’ll be pampering them with lots of good food.

Ruhi Chaturvedi: 'Everything first after your marriage is special'

Shivendraa and Ruhi Chaturvedi

I am really excited for the festival. Everything ‘first’ after your marriage is special. I am in Jaipur this Diwali with Shivendraa and his family. We came to Jaipur after 10 months. The best part about this year is that there will no firecrackers and therefore, less pollution. We have plans to go for family dinner this Diwali.

Manish Raisinghan: 'I am excited to welcome a new family member Sangeita'

Sangeita and Manish Raisinghan

This is going to be different — social distancing, no card parties. I am excited as this year we have a new member to our family, Sangeita. Celebrations are going to be but restricted. We will be communicating with our friends and relatives virtually. Also, I have always encouraged people to not burst firecrackers and this year also, I’ll be doing it too. The rituals will almost be the same which happens at other people households. We will be staying inside the house. It is going to be a home bound Diwali for me and everybody around me.


Mona Singh: 'Will be doing pooja with my husband at my parent's place'

Shyam Gopalan and Mona Singh

Usually my Diwali used to be about going to the Army Club since my father was in the army. I used to go there every year with my gang of friends and my parents. However, this year is going to be different. Since it is my first Diwali post marriage, I will be doing proper pooja with my husband at my parents' place and then we will head to a close friend's house for dinner and to play cards. It will be just a few of us as due to COVID-19 scare we are not making the celebrations grand. Since that friend of mine also lives with his parents so he too is quite careful about the precautions that he is taking keeping in mind the on-going pandemic.

" Nov 18, 2020, 16:24 IST",,Entertainment,"Happy Children’s Day: From Jr NTR to Mahesh Babu, five stars who were once child artists","From the biggest stars to the newly emerging young talent, many of our Tollywood stars were once successful child artists. Even before they were launched with all pomp as a lead actor, many were already familiar to Telugu movie buffs. On this Children’s Day, we bring you five star heroes of Tollywood who aced the silver screen as child artists.



Mahesh Babu
Superstar Mahesh Babu’s charm on screen is not just restricted to the last two decades. Back in 1979, when he was just four-years-old, he made an appearance in the film Needa directed by legendary Dasari Narayana Rao. Mahesh also acted as a child artist in many of his father Superstar Krishna’s films, revealing that he would be allowed to act during summer break. He acted along with his father in movies like Gudachari 117, Koduku Diddina Kapuram and more which turned out to be blockbusters.



Jr NTR

Tarak took the burden of carrying on the Nandamuri legacy way back than his debut as a hero. Known for his ease in delivering mythological dialogues, Tarak was seen in the movie Bala Ramayanam, when he was just 13 years old. The movie was directed by Gunasekhar and Tarak played the role of Lord Rama in this mythological drama. Before that he played a small role in the movie Bramarshi Vishwamitra directed by his grandfather, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao in the year 1991.




Allu Arjun

Allu Arjun’s groovy dance moves are not just popular in Tollywood but in the entire country. Before his debut film Gangotri, Allu Arjun made a cameo and appeared as a young student in Chiranjeevi’s character’s dance school in the movie Daddy. Bunny’s stunning dance moves from a scene in the film had then hinted at what a stylish star he would turn out to be.




Akhil Akkineni

Akhil is unarguably the cutest child actor who later became a star hero in Tollywood. Akhil was just a year old when he played the lead role in the movie Sisindri, inspired by the Hollwood film Baby’s Day Out which turned out to be an all-time blockbuster. The sight of him adorably crawling all over the city was all it took to win hearts and set the cash registers ringing back then. Akhil has of course stated in many interviews later on that he doesn’t remember ever shooting for the film as he was too young.



Teja Sajja

Remember the kid whose screams, “Naayanamma! Nenunnane,” in the movie Indra when his grandmother wonders who will occupy the throne after the death of her son? Teja Sajja was a very popular child artist back in the early 2000s and is now making it big in the movies. He played an important role in the movie Oh! Baby and will soon be seen as a lead in Prasanth Varma’s Zombie Reddy apart from a film with Shivani Rajasekhar."

Here’s what Nusrat Jahan is up to: ""Ever since my childhood, I’ve always been very fond of dressing up for festivals. Seeing lights all around brings me a sense of positivity. Considering the environmental impact of firecrackers, I’ve stopped indulging in it, but I love to see the excitement on the faces of children bursting crackers. I make sure to clean the house and light up every corner with diyas and bulbs. This year, I will miss mingling with friends and attending Diwali parties as I plan to spend a quiet Diwali with my loved ones. I will cook and bake for my family. I hope we all celebrate this Diwali as the festival of lights and not add to the pollution levels. Let’s also think about stray animals and birds who really suffer due to the high-decibel sound, light and smoke emitted by crackers.

This time I'll have to do everything on my own, with her guidance"" she shares.


She further adds, ""For me Diwali is one of the most significant festivals, we also call it as the festival of lights. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This five-day celebration will include good food, fireworks, rangoli, and special lamps. As I'm not in India this year, I'm going to miss the festivities but I will celebrating here, with my husband.""

" Nov 14, 2020, 01:08 IST",,TV,"Mindful, eco-friendly, and safe: Amid pandemic, celebs get set for a minimalistic Diwali","When it comes to festivals we love to celebrate them with pomp, opulence, leaving no stone unturned. Over the years, Diwali has always been all about lighting up every surface, gorging on mithai and snacks, indulging in shopping sprees and having lavish Diwali parties. However, the pandemic has changed it all. With Diwali a few days away, we ask celebs how much the pandemic has changed their perception of celebrating festivals.
Helly Shah plans to be more mindful about health, environment
This year we have celebrated every festival differently. The ongoing pandemic has taught us to be more mindful about our health and environment as the dynamics around us have changed, so will be ensuring I take care of both this Diwali. Be it work, travel or celebrations - we have learnt to take things easy, exercise more caution. Travelling isn’t so easy these days, so this festive season, we can’t simply pack our bags and get going. My festive celebration will be well planned, eco-friendly and safe this year.

Vatsal-Ishita Sheth will have a stay-at-home celebration
Given the present situation, the festive preparation for this year has been low-key. The year 2020 has taught us that nothing can be more important than good health and being with our family and friends. All festive festive celebrations this year have been low-key and Diwali will be no different. After all festivals are all about being with your loved ones and making memories with them. This Diwali will be a safe celebration at home with close family members.
Manav Gohil values the importance of being with family during celebrations
Festivals add life and colour to our mundane routine. Without doubt the pandemic has changed our perception and perspective when it comes to celebrations. This year many of us have enjoyed intimate and low-key celebrations and Diwali will also be the same for me. Although the festive spirit will remain the same, just the way we celebrate will change. I’m taking a three-day break from my current show Shaadi Mubarak and travel to Delhi with my wife and daughter to enjoy a quiet Diwali with my in-laws and family members.

Neil Bhatt wants to celebrate resilience and the life lessons he’s learnt
I have always preferred low-key festive celebrations even before the pandemic. Keeping our environment clean has always been pivotal to me. The pandemic has made us more resilient and we have found ways to sail through these tough times. This year we should celebrate the hard work and resilience of everyone around us and opt for simple, safe celebrations. Since I’ve been busy with Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin, I hardly have time with my family. I’m looking forward to spending quality time with them this festive season with no crackers, only home cooked food.


Aashka Goradia will take special care of my elderly relatives this festive season
The pandemic has taught all of us some very valuable life lessons. While we have braved through it , we have also adapted to the new normal. The sentiments of the festival will naturally remain the same, it’s the way we celebrate it that it has to change and it is for our safety. I’m looking forward to ushering in Diwali more mindfully, taking care of all safety measures and ensuring special care of the elderly members in the family.


Vijayendra Kumeria has learnt to believe in intimate celebrations
I’ve always believed in having low-key celebrations with my loved ones as opposed to grand celebrations for Diwali. And the pandemic has reaffirmed my belief in it. I’m planning to drive down to Ahmedabad so that I can bring my parents to Mumbai. I will make the most of the festivities with them and my extended family. I’m looking forward to indulging in some fresh home-made gujiya, laddoo and will be decking up our house with my wife and daughter, and enjoying quality family time.


Meera Deosthale won’t splurge, will stay home and have a safe & healthy Diwali
The pandemic has changed our perception about many things around us and how to celebrate our festivals is certainly one of them. The pandemic has taught us to value life and good health over materialistic pleasures. For me this year there will be no grand celebrations to welcome Lakshmi home, I am going for a small, no-frills celebration which will be done with good intentions. This year, I won't meet anyone during the festival and will have a quiet celebration at home."
"  Nov 14, 2020, 01:00 IST",Madhureeta Mukherjee,Entertainment,EXCLUSIVE: Janhvi Kapoor: My mom always said on Diwali we should wear something new and bright,"It has been a festive week for Janhvi Kapoor, with close family, delectable traditional food, new clothes, nostalgia in the air — and all these little events and emotions unfolding in her mom’s (Sridevi) beautiful dream house by the beach in Chennai. Last week, the actress along with sister Khushi and dad Boney Kapoor, took off to Chennai, to spend time at her mom’s freshly renovated ancestral home. The Kapoors are back in Mumbai for Diwali, but Janhvi says that she cherishes the time spent there as the trip was special and close to her heart for several reasons.
“My mom’s maternal, ancestral house is in Chennai, and for a long time, we couldn’t stay there as some renovations needed to be done. Papa finally managed to get it done. It is a beach house, which was mom’s dream. We were so busy with our lives in Mumbai that we never paid attention to doing up this house. Kudos to my dad that he could pull it off in the midst of the pandemic. I’m so happy with what he has done with the house, and he’s so emotional about it. He told Khushi and me, ‘It was your mom’s dream, and she always wanted both of you to spend time in this house’. So, this was a very special trip for all of us, and to meet her side of the family after so long was great,” says the actress on an emotional note.


Talking about Diwali celebrations back home in Mumbai, she says, “My mom would always say that on the day of Diwali, on New Year and our birthdays, we should wear something new and bright. I will definitely wear something new, and I will be dressing up after a really long time, so I am excited about it. We will do a small puja at home like we always do, and that will be our celebration.”

Ask her who takes on the charge of prepping the house for the festival and she explains, “My mom had a well-oiled system for what had to be done and all the prep that was required for the festival at home. So, our main house staff sets up the house and decks it up with lights, flowers and diyas.


Given that the pre-Diwali period was all about connecting with her roots and bonding with people who she loves deeply, Janhvi shares a sweet childhood memory of the festival with us. “When we used to visit mom’s Chennai house as kids, we would go out on the streets to see the lights, and then get together and have delicious South Indian delicacies and mango juice. I was always obsessed with mango juice for some reason, and I guess since then I associate mango juice with Diwali,” recalls the actress.


Earlier this year, the actress impressed the audience with her performance in 'Gunjan Saxena — The Kargil Girl', and now she has an interesting mix of films coming up, like 'Dostana 2' and 'Roohi Afzana'. When asked what she wishes for the festival, she says, “I want to do so much amazing work, learn so much and become the best at my craft. Most of all, I want COVID-19 to disappear and theatres to be fully functional. It might sound selfish, but I really want that.”"
"  Nov 14, 2020, 01:00 IST",Debarati S Sen,Entertainment,Composer Mannan Shaah is excited about creating background score,"Composer, singer Mannan Shaah is known for his work in the three films of the ‘Commando’ franchise and also ‘Namaste England’. For the first time the composer has worked on background music.

“Composing songs is another ball game altogether as compared to doing background scores for a film. I just recently debuted as a background score composer. A song is a theme in itself whereas a film score has loads of themes together to suit the mood of the scene and screenplay of the film. Emphasis on the story, screenplay and dialogues is of utmost importance while designing background score for a film. Songs are widely used only in Indian films, but with international films theres more emphasis to Background Score soundtracks. It’s a very new experience for me but I’m enjoying every bit of it.”


His song ‘Akhiyaan Milavanga’ from ‘Commando 3’ celebrates one year on November 14, and when we ask him about it, Mannan says, “It has truly been a gratifying experience. It’s a song I have truly believed in and people have loved it too. Arijit had rendered the song exceptionally well and I feel that it is one of the best sung songs of his career. Sruthy Sasidharan is a voice I truly believed in and she has done all justice to it. I can’t even be more thankful to Sahil Sultanpuri who has penned such unique lyrics.”

Mannan adds, “The best part about ‘Akhiyaan Milavanga’ is that it has been creating new moments in my life every single day. We have more than one thousand covers of the song in less than a year. And such amazing talents have covered the song. Some very popular playback singers of our country have sung their cover versions of it which is rare nowadays. The song has reached to the remotest interiors of India and we have found some incredible talents singing their versions of it. I have also come across musicians from the international music scene singing their hearts out and all the love for it is still pouring even today. It is an honor to know and hear such incredible talent and I’m truly thankful to ‘Akhiyaan Milavanga’ to introduce me to them. These are the moments I cherish the most.”"

""I will be spending Deepavali on a film set this year. I am glad to have a working Deepavali as it is the best way to spend it this year, after so many months of no work. I will be on the set of Old Monk. I hope everyone gets to see light in their lives and also, return to normalcy this festival,"" shares Aditi.

Recalling the unlock phase, she says, ""There was a temporary halt on all work, now everything has resumed with a bang. I am feeling good. The past few months had put me in a weird zone. I am pretty much a home bird. But the pandemic made being at home become boring and uninteresting for the first time. It got torturous after a point as even after completing every single domestic chore, I had too much spare time left. How many books can one read or how many movies can one watch! I am glad there is some sort of a semblance of normalcy now.""


Getting back to work now, however, includes a lot of safety measures to prep for as well. “I was yearning to be back at work. Interestingly, we are all fine. There is no question of fear of the pandemic while we are on the set. We have shot for this particular film right through the unlock phase now. On the set, we pep ourselves up and keep the mood upbeat with songs and jokes. I also shot for a bit in Chikmagalur for Tribble Riding recently,"" Aditi explains.

“In Tribble Riding, I play the role of a relatable character, a girl of today’s age and time. My co-star Ganesh sir and I are required to have the right kind of chemistry for the screen, and he is fabulous as he makes me feel so comfortable on the set,” says Aditi, who will soon be part of two other new teams, as she will shoot for Ganjanana And Gang and Srikrishna Paramatma."

Given the current situation, events are few and far between in the city. But those that are taking place are ensuring they restrict the number of guests and follow all necessary precautions. These events have also become the places to display ones Indian finery that have not been used much this year."

Children's Day Special: Bollywood actors want to revisit these days of their lives,"What added to the festive weekend was the Children’s Day celebration across the country yesterday. BT got in touch with celebrities, who went back in time and recalled their favourite childhood memories...



Ileana D’Cruz: Wish I could go back and spend more time with my uncle

I wish I could have spent more time with my uncle. I grew up with him in Goa. He was a father figure and I was close to him. He made me feel special and helped keep the child in me alive.




Freddy Daruwala: No cell phones during our childhood, but life was still beautiful then

I’d like to go back to the 7-9 year old me! At the time, my teachers and my friends in school were kind and loving. My parents were much younger and fitter then. I can also get to watch cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Kapil Dev playing together. We always looked forward to our school vacations. There were no cell phones, but life was still beautiful then.



Urmila Matondkar: Summer vacations with grandparents in Konkan were divine

I would certainly like to go back to the times when my brother and I would go to our grandparents’ home in Konkan for summer vacations. It was absolutely scenic, serene and a divine experience. The place has many old stunning temples, running waters, untouched clean sea and white shores. And above all, a backyard full of world famous Alphonso mangoes. Our grandpa who was a math teacher, would also make us write and recite tables till 30, every single day! That’s the reason I am still strong at mathematics.




Adah Sharma: Childhood were the best days, minus the geometry exams

To be honest, I don’t know which moment of my life I want to revisit. I would have said rolling in the sand, but I just did that yesterday (laughs!). Childhood were the best days of my life. The only part I didn’t enjoy were the geometry exams, which makes me grateful that it does not feature in my life now.



Vivan Bhathena: I would like to spend time with my grandmother and my dad

I enjoyed spending time with my grandmother. I was always pressured into trying to be like my older cousin, as he was doing well in studies. My solace used to be food and my granny's cooking. She taught me how to cook, clean and also played badminton with me. Even at 70, she used to beat us hollow at the game. She used to make me my favorite food everyday. When I was winning the Mister India (World, 2001) crown on stage she died in a hospital of blood cancer and I never really got to say good bye to her. So, if I could travel back in time, I would spend time with her and even my dad, who passed away quite suddenly too.




Karishma Tanna: Childhood is incomplete without papa

I would like to go back to spending time with my papa. He was extremely good with math. He used to make me learn the tables, and for me to learn them well, he would weave in animated stories.




Mithila Palkar: Summer vacations without the 7 pm curfew time were unforgettable

I’d like to revisit the time when summer vacations were still a thing and I could spend endless hours just playing games with my friends downstairs. Our parents didn’t call us back home at 7pm and that was the biggest thrill. There was no curfew time and we could play for as long as we wanted! Those times were innocent and precious.




Akshay Oberoi: Am curious about the time when I was three, like my son is now

When I see my three-year-old son Avyaan, I feel like going back to that age. The equation between parents and children at this age is so pure. Unfortunately, we don’t remember how we were with our parents at the age of three, so, I would like to travel to that phase of my childhood to observe the equation and the bonding that I shared with my parents.




Zareen Khan: I was the proverbial teacher’s pet

Hands down, it has to be my school life! I was very popular in school, because I was good in my academics. Having scored a distinction, I was a teacher’s pet. And that’s why I could also get away with almost all the mischief and pranks I would play. At that age, stress and tension meant exams, but life as an adult has taught us the real meaning
of stress!



Vardhan Puri: Want to revisit birthdays, where my grandparents were present

I would like to visit the times when I had all my grandparents with me at my birthday parties. We used to have the best time cutting cakes and playing games. I miss them dearly. The love of grandparents is pure, wholesome and extraordinary.




Maanvi Gagroo: Would like to go back to school, but without the exams

If I had to revisit a time period from my childhood, it would have to be my school life, but without the exams! I absolutely loved going to school, but would get anxious before exams. I was a good student. We were (and still are) a group of close friends, but didn’t have any responsibilities, personal or professional. So that is something I’d love to go back to!




Sonnalli Seygall: I enjoyed spending time with my mother and my brother in a park


I want to revisit the time when my mom used to take me and my brother to the beautiful, horticulture park in Kolkata. My brother would be in the pram and I used to push it around, while my mom took us through the park. It had the largest variety of flowers there at the time. Even now when I close my eyes I can actually smell the flowers and the air of that park!





Zaheer Iqbal: Our only worry then was who would be the captain in the next game

I would go back to the time when I was about 12-13 years old. I grew up in a building with 10-12 other children of my age, and every evening we would go downstairs and play. I miss those days with my friends, when the only worry was who would be the captain in the next game."

In fact, it was a twin celebration for her — a Diwali bash along with her father’s birthday yesterday. “I have moved into this beautiful sea-facing house in Juhu. I have done up my drawing room and the terrace really well. I invited a few family members at home to celebrate Diwali as well as my father’s birthday. We all had good food and watched a few films through the night,” Nushrratt.

The actress took this opportunity to showcase her cooking skills. “Being a vegetarian, I tossed up some nice starters using tofu and mushrooms and made pasta to surprise my guests for the Diwali party. It was exciting to bring in Diwali at my new home this year,” she says.

" Nov 15, 2020, 09:42 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,"EXCLUSIVE: Bhumi Pednekar: As a Mumbaikar, I have never seen festivities so subdued in this city, ever!","Bhumi Pednekar, an avid supporter of climate conservation and nature protection, believes in the idea of sustainability, recycling and upcycling to avoid any wastages. She even wore her mother’s sari for Diwali this year instead of buying something new for herself. In a recent conversation with Bombay Times, Bhumi, who recently completed the patchwork and dubbing for Durgavati, opened up about the festive season in India this year.


“I was born and brought up in Mumbai. As a Mumbaikar, I have never seen festivities so subdued in this city. It had never happened that we would pass a navratri without hearing a Phalguni Pathak song from a nearby garba pandal or not witness large processions for Ganpati visarjan. My house is very close to the sea and this year, there was literally no noise and no processions during the festivals. It felt so strange. The activity normally during Ganesh Chaturthi is so high but this year was different. I guess it’s okay and it’s a smart thing to not be on the road. I am glad people during festivals understood the situation and acted responsibly. Like, we normally meet relatives and extended family and friends for Diwali but not this year. It was just us at home. It’s the best way to secure your loved ones. It’s best to just be home and celebrate. Next year, when things are better, we can make up for all this and more.”


Bhumi, who will soon slip into prep mode for Junglee Pictures’ Badhaai Do with Rajkummar Rao, has also been against crackers for a long time. “I am against the idea of bursting crackers. It leads to noise and air pollution, actually it adds to the existing levels. Animals get disturbed and bursting crackers is literally like burning money. The lesser crackers the better. My sister and I stopped bursting crackers when we were still in school; my parents stopped buying them for us. I find it obnoxious that people burst crackers. There is black soot everywhere the morning after Diwali,” says the actress who is a climate warrior.

Talking about how people have adapted their festive celebrations to the new normal, she says, “There is a lot of self awareness that has crept into people. I have seen my colleagues talk about climate change, sustainability and upcycling what they have. My campaign to protect and save the climate comes from a pure space of creating awareness and that is the reason it finds support. The pandemic has awakened people and they know that this healing of the climate is temporary. We have got this chance to correct a lot of things at a big cost. Let’s not be irresponsible.”"
"  Nov 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",Madhu Daithota,Lifestyle,Sreeleela and Sharmiela Mandre show how to use makeup in spite of the mask this festive season,"Deepavali is looking very different this year, owing to the pandemic. With masks the order of the day, women are learning to embrace the new normal and work their festive look around it. Keep it earthy and subtle and opt for matte finish
“This season, makeup is all about going subtle. Women can opt for subtle, dewy and earthy tones and do up their face with some good translucent powder,” says celebrity makeup artiste Vydurya Lokesh. She adds that a good translucent powder in a matte texture is a good bet. “Compact powders seem heavy on the skin. It is best to keep the makeup light and transfer resistant so that you don’t smudge it all over your mask,” observes Vydurya pointing out that metallic eyeliners are a huge hit this season with golden and teal blue emerging top. She points out that a lot of young girls are learning a stroke or two and brushing up on basic makeup skills from online tutorial videos.

Masked, but in style

Celebrity designer Jayanthi Ballal has been working on a lot of fancy masks off late, owing to the festive season. “There’s a high demand for silk and raw silk masks. Be it a sari, salwar or lehenga that women are choosing to wear, we make masks from the same fabric and add a touch of festivity to it through embroidery or some exotic work,” says Jayanthi.

Sandalwood keeps it simple “I love wearing lipstick and miss it now because of the masks,” confesses actress Sreeleela. “So, I’ve learnt to do up my eyes rather elaborately. This Deepavali, I won’t be stepping out of home. I will be celebrating it with my parents. So, I hope to do away with the mask and play dress up,” she says.

Actress Sharmiela Mandre echoes a similar thought and says that she prefers celebrating Deepavali at home. “I bought two simple outfits: a kaftan kurta with a little work on it and another simple churidar kurta. Since masks are the order of the day, one could opt to wear a matte lipstick, as it doesn’t make sense to wear the glossy ones that get smudged on the mask. Subtle base makeup with a semi smokey-eyed look and natural lips will be my look this time,” sums up Sharmiela.


Keep the look fuss free and simple

“Deepavali, in keeping with the current times, has become more about intimate gatherings and sit-down dinners. Since the celebrations have already begun, an increasing number of women are already opting for lighter makeup,” observes makeup and beauty expert Swati Gupta. “Owing to the pandemic, Deepavali will be restricted to limited set of known people, so, when people feel safe, they take off their masks on arrival at the venue and then do a light touch up. In such instances, one can use a non-transferable lipstick and seal the look in with a finishing spray,” shares Swati. In situations where the mask is mandatory, she suggests that people can play up their eyes. “The hairdos can also be interesting and women can choose to wear gajras, colourful flowers and style them with interesting accessories,” she points out. Jewellery is another option and bracelets can become the top pick to highlight your outfit."
"  Nov 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",Praveen Tyagarajan,Entertainment,Tanya-Prabhakaran’s murder mystery takes off in Chennai,"Mani Mahal, the well-known shooting location on Nungambakkam, is buzzing with activity when we arrive. A crew wearing masks is setting up the shot. The film is Rekkai Mulaithen, starring Karuppan girl Tanya Ravichandran and directed by SR Prabhakaran of Sundarapandian fame. The scene that they are shooting involves a plainclothes cop meeting the police commissioner to discuss a case. Tanya, who plays the cop, Aaradhana, walks into the room, takes her seat and then the two actors have a conversation.
Once the shot is approved, we get talking to SR Prabhakaran. “This is my first movie as a producer. Rather than have a story for the sake of heroism, I decided to have one in which the heroism is organic to the story. My previous three films were all set in south Tamil Nadu, against a village backdrop. I wanted to break the image as a rural film director and do a pucca city-based film. Rather than explain this to producers and convince them, I felt I should produce it myself,” begins the filmmaker, adding, “Tanya’s performance in Karuppan made her familiar even in the interior parts of the state. I’ve always felt strongly about Tamil-speaking girls being given chances, and when I was writing this script, she was the one who came to my mind.”

We ask Prabhakaran about shooting in the pandemic and he says, “We are following the norms set by the government to shoot during this COVID-19 pandemic, and are working with a 50-member crew. And to ensure the crew’s safety, we have provided them with masks, gloves and sanitisers. Cinema has been lying dormant since the lockdown, but it is also the time to remain safe.”
I’m excited to play an ACP

It is a crime thriller and I play an ACP. I am excited to do this role, as this is the first time I’m playing a cop. I’m very happy to be associated with SR Prabhakaran sir.

Aniruddha says, “I didn’t post those images thinking it would get a prompt resolution. Our duty as citizens doesn’t end after we cast our votes. Apart from complaining to authorities whenever we see such black spots, we need to stop throwing litter in public places to keep our surroundings clean. People need to stop thinking that it is the duty pourakarmikas to keep our surroundings clean. ”

To honour the efforts of pourakarmikas, the actor and his wife Keerthi recently felicitated some of them. “We forget the efforts of pourakarmikas who work round-the-clock to keep the city clean, even during the times of Covid-19, and their work needs to be appreciated. We did our bit by felicitating 40 pourakarmikas and giving them Deepavali gifts,” he adds."
"  Nov 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,Dhananjaya spotted in his role as insurance agent in Ratnan Prapancha,"Ever since the state government allowed film shoots to resume, several crews have been heading to one of the nearest and most popular locations — Mysuru. Take, for instance, Sriimurali and Ashika Ranganath, who had a major schedule of Madagaja in the city, as well Sathish Ninasam and Hariprriya, who began shooting for Petromax through the Dasara festivities. Right now, Mysureans may be privvy to the action of the Rohit Padaki-directed Ratnan Prapancha, several sequences of which were being shot along busy roads in the city. The film has Dhananjaya and Reba Monica John in lead roles and here’s what we saw… Ratnan Prapancha is not like my recent commercial outings: Dhananjaya

Dhananjaya, whose career graph has been on the upswing with films like Tagaru and Popcorn Monkey Tiger, plays an insurance agent in Ratnan Prapancha. The film, he says, is nothing like his commercial outings and sees him play a normal, middle-class guy. “I play Ratnakara, an insurance agent who works over time, to make a living for his family. The film’s subject is very different, and will be relatable for family audiences. Umashree plays my mother and is a part of the Mysuru schedule. It is a great experience to work with her. In the second schedule, we will shoot in Bengaluru, Gadag and later in Kashmir. After a slew of massy movies, I am back to playing a normal guy, much like how I was in Director’s Special,” says Dhananjaya, who was seen riding a bike across city roads as part of the shoot.

On shooting during the pandemic, he says, “We have to get adjusted to the new normal until a vaccination is out. It is tough for actors to maintain protocol, as fans ask for selfies, which we can’t deny. I have shot for four different movies since the lockdown; sometimes even junior artists ask for photographs, which makes it difficult to maintain social distance.”

Safety is top priority on the set, says director

For another sequence, the team headed to a defunct wedding hall in the heart of the city. Before commencing shooting, every member of the crew and cast was subjected to thermal screening, wearing of masks was compulsory for crew, while every half an hour, crew and cast were made to sanitise their hands. Director Rohit says, “Ratnan Prapancha is a complete family drama; it’s a story that takes place in every normal middle-class household. There is a clear mother and son sentiment, but one that does not involve melodrama. This is a story of how middle-class people lead happy lives by inculcating values, despite having limited financial resources.”"
" Nov 16, 2020, 09:58 IST",V Lakshmi,Entertainment,Vijay: I wanted to make this Deepavali memorable for Dhruvvaa as it was his first,"It was a different kind of ‘thala Deepavali’ for Vijay. “Usually, I’d be shooting or busy with post-production during the festival. But this time, I ensured I was home because it’s my son, Dhruvvaa Vijay’s first Deepavali. My sister and brother had come over with their families and it was a big reunion for us,” says the filmmaker, adding, “We did poojai in the morning and then, burst crackers later. I’m not very fond of them, but we wanted to make the Deepavali memorable for Dhruvvaa, even though I’m sure he won’t remember much of it when he grows up (laughs). We thought he would be scared of the sounds because he’s hardly five months old, but when his nephew was bursting crackers, he was smiling.”
He admits the lockdown was a blessing because he got to spend more time with his son. “He is so young and I enjoy spending time with him. He is the centre of all our attention. In fact, on the day of Deepavali, all my family doted on him and he was quite enjoying that. He has just started recognising people, so he hasn’t really started missing me when I travel for shoot. Moreover, he is very close to my mom and dad and they take care of him,” he says


Vijay has resumed work on the magnum opus, Thalaivi, which has Kangana Ranaut playing late actress and former chief minister of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa. While he wrapped a schedule in Hyderabad recently, the last one is all set to begin from this week. Ask him how difficult it was to shoot the movie amid the pandemic, and he says, “It’s a political film and we require a large crowd. So, it was naturally a difficult process. In the first schedule that we had post lockdown, we filmed a parliament sequence. We followed all protocols, but it was emotionally taxing. There was a fear factor playing in our mind — we were scared and worried that no one should get affected. We ensured everyone sanitised themselves before the shoot — junior artistes, technicians lead actors, everyone. We sanitised the location before and after the shoot. Every day, I would ask if everyone was okay on the set and if anyone had any symptoms. My production team did all the groundwork and was in touch with all the other departments. It’s very difficult to shoot a film like Thalaivi with 75 members because the technical crew itself is quite big. So, we had to do a lot of juggling. We planned scenes with less number of people. We also shot Kanganaji’s opening song, which was choreographed by Brinda master. In our final schedule, which will last for about 20 days, we will film montages.”

So, did it take quite a bit of planning before they went on floors again? “Good planning is essential for any film, COVID-19 or not. Now, we have to be extra careful, and so, we had to do extra planning. The number of shooting hours is restricted, so those hours should be productive and you should get what you want. We wanted to achieve the day’s target and so, we planned everything to the minute. It was a time-consuming process, but after the pandemic, things have become different, and difficult. We have to get used to the new normal,” he says.



While Vijay has plunged neck-deep into work, not many know that he himself has recovered from COVID-19. “It was a tough time for us as some of my friends and family had contracted the virus, too. I think everyone has to be really careful. I was careful, but I still don’t know how I got affected. Awareness about the virus and the recovery time are both important. I had recovered completely when I started shooting, but it did strain me physically as I was constantly on the move on the set. Building your stamina and immunity is important,” he states.



The filmmaker is all praise for Kangana. “Everyone knows how good she is as an actress. Her screen presence, performance and dialogue delivery as Jaya ma’am was amazing. To look like Amma, she took a lot of effort; she put on 17 kilos and had to reduce 15 kilos for a song. She also had other films to start and had to undergo physical transformation for them, too. She did face a lot of challenges,” says Vijay, adding, “She is dedicated to her craft and her knowledge about filmmaking and pulse of the audience is amazing. She has a lot to contribute, not just for her character, but for the whole film. During the script-reading session, she was telling us how we should have a really good introduction scene for Madhoo, who is playing Janaki amma.”"
"  Nov 16, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,Entertainment,Looking forward to be directed by Duniya Vijay: Mokshitha Pai,"Mokshitha Pai, who rose to fame as the title character on the Kannada TV show Paaru, is making the transition to the big screen with Duniya Vijay’s next directorial, which has debutant Lakshman Gopal in the lead. “I was surprised when I got a call from Vijay sir to act in his movie. He wanted to see me without makeup. After I met him, he said he wanted to cast a girl with a cute face, which he found in me. He also said that he had seen me in Paaru and was confident about my acting capabilities. He did, however, ask me to lose a few kilos, for which he has even given me diet chart to follow. Even though I have acted in a serial, I am quite nervous about facing the camera for a film,” says Mokshitha.

Interestingly, the actress adds that this is not the first film offer that has come her way. “There were several other offers earlier, but I rejected them all, as I don’t want to disappoint people who have showered me with so much love for playing Paaru. My character in the movie, which has a romantic love story, is quite similar to Paaru, but there is a rawness in the subject, which adds a twist to the tale. I believe this is the perfect debut for me. We begin shooting in December or January,” she says.

The move to the big screen, though, does not mean adieu to TV. “I am looking at balancing both. I shoot for about 10 days in a month for the serial, so I have enough time to concentrate on films. Even producer Dileep Raj has said that he will help me rearrange dates, so that I can devote time to cinema,” she sums up."

Alia shared a bunch of pictures dressed in a pretty light pink lehenga on social media, and wrote, “This Diwali I wanted to do something different, instead I wore something different. This lehenga is a labour of love of so many amazing people — the children of AOL free schools whose names are embroidered on it and karigars who worked across many months. Wishing you all a very Happy Diwali and hope everyone’s in the pink of health, just like my outfit (sic).” The outfit is created from a collection of drawings made by 35 children studying in free schools using waste fabric. Each panel of the lehenga sported by the actress, represented a part of our eco-system — the two poles, deserts, seas, oceans, waterfalls, tropical rainforests, river-beds and even the solar system.



In a video that was shot by the Riteish’s wife, Genelia Deshmukh, his mother Vaishali Deshmukh showed a beautiful blue sari from her collection, and in the next shot, the actor and his sons are seen wearing kurtas fashioned out of it. “Maa ki purani saari, bachchon ke liye Diwali ken aye kapde. Happy Diwali… #recycle, (sic)” Riteish wrote along with the video. With repurposing and recycling being the keywords in the fashion industry today, the actor showed a cool way to take the movement ahead on a personal level."
"  Nov 16, 2020, 01:00 IST",Niharika Lal,Lifestyle,Meet ITBP’s mini combat soldiers,"Five-year-olds Olga and Olyesha, whom the ITBP officials call “warrior sisters”, gave birth to 17 puppies a month ago
As their mom chases a red ball, eight puppies excitedly follow her. While one of them spots the ball and wants to grab it, others try to get hold of their mom, and a few others are simply too lazy to even get up. They roll on the floor and cuddle. An ITBP (Indo Tibetan Border Police) personnel commands from a distance, “Olyesha, khelo khelo”, and she again starts running towards the ball. Since the last one month, this has been a regular scenario at the ITBP’s National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) at Bhanu in Panchkula, Haryana, which has recently welcomed 17 puppies of Belgian Malinois breed.


‘These 17 pups are a result of scientific matchmaking’ Five-year-old Olga and Olyesha, whom the ITBP officials call ‘warrior sisters’, gave birth to 17 puppies a month ago. Six-year-old Gala, who’s a counter-insurgency grid hero, is their father, and all three dogs had their tenure in Chhattisgarh, where ITBP is deployed. All three have an excellent service record, and that’s why ITBP officials are already calling these 17 pups mini combat soldiers.

The NTCD is under the command of DIG SB Sharma. DIG Sudhakar Natarajan, the senior-most K9/vet officer of the ITBP, says, “This is a superb result of a highly scientific breeding protocol of the ITBP, whereby the bloodline of the sire and dam had been analysed for five generations before the ‘matchmaking’. These pups are of the Malinois breed, which is fearless, tough, loyal to the core, with one of the finest olfactory capabilities.” SS Deswal, DG, ITBP, congratulated the entire veterinary team for the safe delivery and care of the pups.


ITBP trains dogs with the approach ‘only rewards, no punishment’
At the training centre, a notice board reads, “Train yourself before you attempt to train a dog.” Officials there tells us, “The handlers need to have high-level intelligence, should be sensitive and love dogs.”

The handler should also be able to read the subtle changes in the dog’s behaviour, like why and when it is lifting its ears or a sudden movement of its eyes. The handlers at the ITBP centre have to go through an aptitude test – dog handler aptitude battery test – to get their psychological profile. The ITBP trains dogs with the approach ‘only rewards, no punishment’. If a dog does good work, it is given a reward, and if it doesn’t, the reward is taken away. The dog gets the message, but it’s not punished if it fails to perform. Another major focus is to strengthen the bond between the dog and handler.



ITBP officials say, “The secret is love. Every day, 15 minutes are kept aside for a talk between dog and its handler when the latter sits with his dog and speaks to him, he just talks gibberish, pats him and it forms a bond between them.” They add, “The resonance between a handler and dog is very important. The better they understand each other, the more helpful it is in conducting an operation. The dog looks at its handler as the top dog and the handler treats the dog as a human being.”



Naamkaran ceremony to take place soon

For identification, while some puppies have a red collar, others have a yellow collar. None of these pups has been named yet, but the ITBP will be organising a naamkaran ceremony soon. The officials say that names can’t be of more than two syllables and will be chosen accordingly.


IG Ishwar Singh Duhan, who is posted at the ITBP Headquarters in Delhi, says that other forces will be able to induct these pups after getting the approval from Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). When the pups turn three months old, they will introduced to their handlers. Their basic obedience training will begin once they are four months old, following which advance training will begin."
"  Nov 16, 2020, 01:00 IST",,Entertainment,Mouni Roy: I am going to miss celebrating Bhai Dooj with my brother this year,"After spending eight months away from Mumbai, Mouni Roy returned to the city recently. However, the actress couldn’t participate in Diwali festivities as work kept her busy, and she will also have to settle for a virtual Bhai Dooj ceremony with her younger brother Mukhar Roy, who is currently in their hometown Cooch Behar, West Bengal. Mouni says, “I have so many fond memories of celebrating Bhai Dooj with Mukhar. As kids, our parents dressed both of us as Lord Krishna during one of the Bhai Dooj ceremonies. Actually, they dressed him as Krishna and maine bhi zidd kardi that even I want to be dressed like that (laughs!).”


Recalling fond memories of the occasion, she further adds, “During our puja, we would never use water, instead, we used to add dew drops to the kumkum or chandan (sandalwood). Being the kid of the house, my brother would be asleep, while we sisters would wake up early and go to collect dew drops around the greens near our home in Bengal.

Festivities at our home called for good food and lots of mithai like nariyal laddoos, rosogolla, payesh (kheer), nolen gurer sondesh (a traditional Bengali sweet), etc. My family is into music, so we used to have beautiful musical sessions, too.”

About the equation the brother-sister share, Mouni elaborates, “My brother is over 10 years younger than me, so earlier on, we had that typical relation where we used to fight a lot. But as we grew up, we started loving and respecting each other a lot more. Through my journey from my hometown to Mumbai, and in my endeavour to become an actress, he has been a silent supporter. He has always encouraged me with my art. At one point of time, I wanted to learn to play the guitar. I saw my brother learning it by watching online videos. He learnt it fast and very well. On realising that I have a good ear for music, he surprised me with a guitar during one Bhai Dooj celebrations. I am going to miss celebrating the festival with my brother this year.”"

The original song has been sung by Vasu himself and has been picturised on Prakash Belavadi. Vasu has also composed music for the same whereas the lyrics are by Kabir Das.

The acoustic version of the track was released by Vasu today and shows the singer performing in a green open space. The musician has been working and releasing original music as well. Earlier this year, in June, just ahead of World Music Day, Vasu had released a new song titled Maula. He had sung the number only at private and intimate gatherings before its release and felt that that under current circumstances of the pandemic, the lyrics of the song would resonate with people. The musician then released a remix of the track, with a completely new video.


""This song was written by me a couple of years ago. It is a conversation between the supreme being and myself, and hence the title Maula. The approach, however, is informal and the lyrics address the supreme being in that manner. The current times are such that people are constantly looking for reassurance and are inclined towards taking spiritual path,” Vasu had told us about the track."

The multilingual film will also have Sara as one of the leads. While we are used to seeing Sara playing sweet, innocent characters, director Vivek says that this film will be a game-changer for her.

“Be it films like Deiva Thirumagal or Saivam, Sara has been cast in innocent roles. This movie is a female-centric gangster film, which will see Sara in a bold avatar. She plays a college student who is on a mission to take revenge. It is a very intense and mature character. This film will be a transformation of sorts for Sara in her film career. Initially, I thought she would be apprehensive about it. But she was very enterprising and took up the role. As a writer, I am happy that she agreed to come on board for this movie. Sara’s character will be there throughout the film, alongside Priya Mani,” he says.


The team will begin shooting in Mumbai from December. “The entire film is set in Mumbai. We will wrap up the first schedule before Christmas and will shoot two other schedules in January 2021. We will also be shooting a small portion in Chennai for about a week,” says Vivek. The film also stars anchor Vishno Warrier and television actor Akshaya in pivotal roles.

About his film, Boxer with Arun Vijay, he says, “Yes, there has been a delay. But we will begin shooting in early 2021."""

They need to stay clear of food items that can spike their blood sugar level, further worsening the symptoms. But most people are often confused about their food choices. To clear this confusion, we talked to Chandigarh-based dietitian Shreya, who shared with us what a diabetic patient should eat and what they should avoid. Talking to Etimes Lifestyle she said that ""diabetes is a condition which causes the blood sugar levels to fluctuate. It is a chronic condition, but can be managed and even reversed with the right lifestyle changes and diet"". Here we have listed some food items diabetes patients should eat and some they should avoid.
FACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST


What to eat
Jamun Vinegar: The black fruit is loaded with Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Iron and other health-friendly nutrients. It is good for skin, gums and even chronic diseases like diabetes. The dietitian recommends having jamun vinegar to keep the blood sugar level in check. You just have to add a teaspoon of jamun vinegar in half a glass of water and drink the concoction 15 minutes before breakfast and lunch.
Methi seeds (Fenugreek seeds): The small fenugreek seeds are high in soluble fiber, which can slow down the digestion process and prevent a sudden spike in the blood sugar level. You can have these seeds either in powdered form or have fenugreek soaked water. Add 2 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds in 6 glasses of water and leave it overnight. Drink this water in the morning.


Eat low GI breakfast: A low Glycemic Index (GI) foods increase glucose level slowly in your body. So, having food low in GI in the morning can help you manage your blood sugar level easily. Oatmeal, barely are some healthy breakfast options for diabetes patients. Barely can also be an excellent alternative to wheat.


Other fruits and vegetables to eat: Besides, there are some fruits and vegetables that are excellent for consumption by a diabetic patient as they keep the blood sugar level in control. Cucumbers, tomatoes, iceberg, radish, papaya, pear, watermelons, apples, oranges, sweet lemon, and bottle-gourd should be a part of a regular meal.


Fruits and vegetables to avoid: There are few vegetables and fruits that should be completely avoided by a diabetic patient as they are known to spike the blood sugar level. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, jackfruit, mangoes, grapes, dates, bananas, beetroot and carrots are some natural products that should be consumed in limited quantities or best should be avoided.


The bottom line
For a diabetic patient, it is important to eat at regular intervals to keep their blood sugar level in check. Irregular meal timing often leads to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, both of which possess great health threats. So, setting your meal timing is important."

She gets into a fight with Aly Goni first and next with Eijaz Khan.
Kavita is infuriated, and her fight with Eijaz related to the cleanliness leads to a major heated argument. The argument goes so far that Kavita went on to push Eijaz away during the clash.

Kavita got annoyed during her fight with Aly and Eijaz that she even went on to call the Bigg Boss house as ‘hell house’. Further, she felt that she is being targeted and shown in a bad light on TV.
Later, Kavita was seen discussing and expressing her desire to leave the show as her good behaviour is also twisted and shown as her bad behaviour. And if this is the case, then she does not want to stay in the show and waste this time of her life.

The FIR actress is further seen saying that if she is turning into a negative personality on the show then neither she needs to be in the show nor does the show need her.


Moreover, Kavita mentioned that she even notices host Salman Khan’s behaviour, words and expressions when she tries to talk and explain herself to him during the ‘Weekend Ka Vaar’. And it seems like he also conders her as a negative person. She said, “Main unki ek-ek expression, ek-ek line jo wo bolte hain, mai wo bhanp gayi hu ki main kaisi dikh rahi hu (I have paid attention to all his words and expressions, and understood how am I looking in the show.)”


The actress furthermore said that when she had entered the show she had thought that no one else but Salman would understand her. But to her disappointment, Salman doesn’t even look interested when she tries to explain anything to him. Kavita said, “He doesn’t listen. He is not interested.”"

It is to be noted that the director had previously given a memorable bike chase sequence in Mankatha, his film with Ajith Kumar. Can fans expect a similar one for STR, who is a self-confessed fan of Thala?

Maanaadu has Simbu essaying the role of a young Muslim man called Abdul Khaaliq. The shoot of the film is expected to be wrapped by January 2021. The highly anticipated film, which is produced by Suresh Kamatchi, has Kalyani Priyadarshan as its female lead.

The shoot of the action thriller has been wrapped up, and Raima says she had a lovely time shooting for the film. “I was approached for the film last year. We finished shooting a lot of the movie last year, in Chennai and Kolkata. After the lockdown, we completed the rest of the portions,” says Raima.

Ask her what made her say ‘yes’ to the film and she says, “I have always wanted to do a film in Tamil. My sister (Riya Sen) has done Tamil films and I’ve heard a lot of nice things about the industry from her. So, when I got this offer from Naveen, I thought, why not? It’s an action thriller, and I have a feisty role. I’ve also heard good things about Vijay Antony. So, what better way to make my mark in the Tamil film industry.”


The actress started shooting for the film first in Chennai. “I met Naveen and others for the first time in Chennai last year. I’d been to the city several years ago. So, it felt nice to be back here for the shoot. Vijay Antony is a sweet, down-to-earth person, with a great sense of humour. Naveen is a young filmmaker with amazing energy and had some new, different ideas. I also met Akshara (Haasan) and she is very sweet. I had a pleasant experience filming in the city. I’m excited to make my debut in Tamil,” she says.

So, was it easy to get a grasp of the language? “Naveen was very helpful. Even the lines that I really couldn’t say in Tamil, he helped me say in such a way that it matched the lip-sync of the dialogues. Riya said she found Tamil an easy language to learn, but for me, Telugu was easy to grasp. I’d say Tamil was tough, but Malayalam was the most difficult to learn,” she states."

The actress, who is popular for her role as Suhani in the show 'Suhani Si Ladki', says that she happened to visit Delhi for the first time, and there couldn’t have been a better place than this city for her wedding shopping. “I always wanted to come to Delhi, I wanted to see so many places, but I managed to come here only for two days, and those two days were spent shopping,” says Rajshri, who visited Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh with some of her family members and Gaurav, who also played her on-screen brother in 'Suhani Si Ladki'.

The actress shares that it was a task for her to choose her wedding lehenga. “When I went to Chandni Chowk, I saw so many lehenga and sari shops there and I was like, ‘Yahan toh market khatam hi nahi ho rahi hai.’ I saw so many lehengas, but I wanted something subtle. In fact, I wanted to wear white on my wedding, but my family did not like the idea. So I had to go through a lot of bright, heavily embroidered lehengas to finally find what I was looking for. I am glad that I could wrap up my wedding shopping in Delhi. I had already shopped for my saris from Mumbai,” says Rajshri, who was happy to visit Paranthe Wali Gali and savour other famed delicacies from Old Delhi. “I really enjoyed it, but the only thing that bothered me was that there was so much crowd in Chandni Chowk. There was no way to maintain social distancing as there were so many people in those narrow lanes. I have had COVID-19, so I have been extremely cautious and I was also worried about the safety of my family members,” she adds.

I am planning if I could have a small celebration with them when I return to Mumbai. Even during the wedding, we all have to take safety precautions and guests will have to wear a mask.

"  Nov 18, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,Lifestyle,Can designers do away with ‘fat tax’?,"In fashion and especially couture, fat tax refers to the practice of charging extra for clothes in bigger sizes
One of the biggest topics of discussion in the Indian fashion industry right now is ‘fat tax’ – charging extra for plus size clothes. On one side of the debate are people and models who say that ‘inclusivity’ is still just a PR stunt in the industry, while on the other side are designers, who say that charging extra for bigger sizes is not a standard practice but is done only when more fabric and embroidery is required to make outfits in certain sizes, thus driving up the manufacturing cost.

‘Fashion industry is yet to embrace inclusivity’
Delhi-based model Vernika Jain, who has walked the ramp for a number of brands promoting plus size clothing, says, “There is more discussion on inclusivity in the fashion world and less inclusion.” Vernika adds that though designers and brands might say that they believe in inclusivity, “they design for curvy women and not plus sizes. If they do create clothes in bigger sizes, they charge extra. I have worked at a manufacturing firm also, there isn’t much difference in costing when designing for plus sizes.”


Social media influencer Shraddha Gurung, who has worked with different fashion brands, says, “Many brands ride on important issues like trends and use words like ‘inclusive’ or ‘sustainable’ just to get good PR. There are some that are bringing a positive change, but there are so many brands that now talk about inclusivity after years of looking down on other body types – both in their private and commercial spaces – and that deeply upsets me.”


‘There is a logic behind charging extra, it is not to make anyone feel bad’
Designers say that it is not a standard practice to charge extra for plus sizes. They add that only when the costing goes up in creating a particular size of certain designs that they change the price. Explains designer Rina Dhaka, “I truly believes in inclusion and have done plus size shows. Our pricing is the same for sizes XS to XXL. It is only when we have to create a size beyond that and we require a change of fabric, or any other material, that we have to charge extra. When we are doing a mass production of plus size outfits for the international market, the pricing will be higher as the costing will go up.” Designer Nikita Mhaisalkar, who has also done plus size shows in the past, adds, “I do not always charge extra for plus sizes. But when the costing goes up, I have no option but to charge an additional amount.”




Designer Nida Mahmood says, “The simple logical reason for charging marginally extra price for some sizes is that if X amount of fabric is being used in creating one outfit and 2X is being used for another outfit, the second outfit will have a different pricing. This is just to cover costs, not to make anyone feel bad or make some point.” Talking about couture and its pricing, designer Neeta Lulla shares, “In my work which is mostly customised, when a consumer sees an off-the-rack outfit that is not too embellished, we do the necessary changes without extra cost. However, if it is an outfit from a small-sized collection with a lot of embroidery, and it needs to be recreated in a different size, pricing will change. The cost incurred in creating that piece will be high as the entire piece needs to be made as per certain specifications and the technicalities need to be reworked.”


A step towards change

Designer duo Gauri and Nainika recently decided to do away with the practice of charging extra for plus sizes. In a message to the anonymous Instagram handle Diet Sabya, that recently brought up this discussion, the duo wrote, “Just wanted to share that we had an extra charge on and off as well for orders above a UK 16…it was always a debate and Gauri and I were uncomfortable with it. But somehow didn’t give it the thought and attention it should’ve been given. And it remained…After looking at your coverage, we discussed that it is unfair and unethical and should never have been there. It’s been cancelled from our t&c’s.” Another designer, Nikasha, also sent a message to the handle, saying, “We, as a fashion house, have taken an immediate decision to not charge our customers any extra charges for placing an order with us for a particular garment in a larger size.”



Designer Shruti Sancheti says that there are many labels that have not been charging extra, and going forward, more designers and brands will follow it. “We, as a brand, have always practiced inclusivity. Our designs from size XS to XXL are priced the same. Even if we charge extra for a particular outfit, it is because of the change in fabric or embroidery, but never due to size. Designers want a wider reach, and most of them follow uniform pricing,” she says.



Designer Narendra Kumar adds, “The concept of inclusivity is still new to the Indian fashion industry, and questions like ‘Why charge additional amount for plus sizes?’ are important and should be discussed. Over time, more designers will start thinking over these issues and will go for standard pricing for all sizes.”"

Says family time has been therapeutic,"Ileana D’Cruz is in Karnal, Haryana where she has resumed shooting for Unfair & Lovely with Randeep Hooda. She recently spent a month with her family in the US. The actress, who was all by herself through the lockdown in Mumbai, rushed to Texas during the Unlock phase.

Talking to BT about it, she says, “I met my mom, brother and sister after a long time. I felt such an overwhelming sense of relief on seeing them. It’s only after meeting them that I could breathe again in peace. I didn’t realise how much I needed it. I was trying to be strong when I was alone for five months during the lockdown. I was pushing myself, saying that I can survive without seeing my family. But when we reunited, I wondered how I functioned without them.”

Ileana cherishes her one-month stay there, and says she got pampered by her mother, who cooked delicious food for her. The two also had unending conversations for hours. “I remember how mom chased me around the house for the initial one week, looking for an opportunity to hug me. But I’d run away from her, reminding her that I had to be quarantined (laughs!),” she recalls.


Talking to BT earlier, Ileana had opened up about the therapy sessions she was undergoing during the lockdown. However, she tells us that she didn’t need therapy when she was with her family. “The family time did wonders for my mental health. For me, spending time with family is therapeutic! It’s the most soothing thing in the world,” she says, adding that she will be back in the US with her family by the year end. “I have decided that I am going to end the year with my family by my side. Also, December is Christmas time, and I always bring in the festival with my folks,” she reveals.


Meanwhile, talking about the experience of shooting for a film in the pandemic, Ileana says, “We are taking supreme levels of precautions to feel safe while shooting in these times. There have been occasions like my birthday (November 1) and even Diwali, but we didn’t really celebrate as such as we wanted to focus on work and finish it off smoothly.”"

Amidst the grim times, festivities brought in a lot of positivity for many. This included Baahubali actress Tamannaah Bhatia who in fact was tested COVID positive and underwent treatment at a hospital in Hyderabad.
She says, “Festive season has brought a smile on my face. At a time when there is so much negativity, even a small little amount of positivity can make you happy. Like, even if there is an ice cream coming to my place I would want to celebrate that. I didn’t leave out on any opportunity to celebrate Diwali. Actually, I can use every iota of festivities, in these grim times, to bring a smile on my face.”
While all hale and hearty today, and back to work, when BT had reached out to Tamannaah after her treatment for coronavirus, the actress had said, “The thing with our profession is that we are exposed to a lot of people on the sets. While you can be in a mask and safety gear, on camera you have to take it off and that makes you vulnerable. At home I am trying to eat healthy and take rest. I am trying to rehabilitate. I am working on my fitness level by doing yoga , as the illness has taken toll on my stamina. Our job requires us to be physically strong. I am trying to gain that right now.”"

If you used natural, floral decorations, don’t throw them away just yet. Here's what you can do to repurpose the floral decorations to generate less waste...
Make your own organic rangoli
If you had used marigold or rose flowers, dry the petals thoroughly. Once dried, add a pinch of turmeric powder to this to avoid insects or pests. Store in an air tight jar and use it as organic rangoli.


Grow your own marigolds Flowers such as marigolds are a mine of seeds. Dry the flowers and pull out the petals gently. You will find seeds at the end of the petals. Separate them and use them to grow your own marigold plants at home.

Go the composting way
Instead of throwing away all the flowers, add them to your composting bin and let it turn into manure. If you do not have a composting bin at home, put the flowers in a pot and mix it with a little mud. The flowers will decompose naturally.

Make skincare products with flowers

Petals of flowers like jasmine, roses and calendula can be used in your skincare regime. Boil rose petals in water for four minutes. Pour the solution in a bottle and use as a face mist. This acts as a toner. Similarly, jasmine petals can be dried and mixed with face scrubs and masks.


Make your own potpourri

Another good way of using up the flowers and flower buds is by making your own potpourri. Dry the flowers that you wish to keep in your potpourri bowl. Once dried mix them gently, add a few drops of essential oil and place it in the corner of the room.

Though it will be some time before the dancing shoes and designer togs come out of their hiding places, party peeps are beginning to block dates on their calendars as the invites slowly start trickling in. The handful of events that have taken place recently have been low-key and restricted to a limited guest list. Even the watering holes, where in the good times (read pre-COVID) people would have given themselves to gay abandon, are keeping it down. Some fizz, but definitely no buzz. Inveterate purveyors of Chennai’s party thrum give us an insider’s perspective as to what the party scene is like now and when the actual rockin’ and rollin’ gonna begin...


‘I try to be careful and safe while going clubbing nowadays’
I really like going to clubs especially because of the good vibes. While it is scary for people to step out, people are realising that this is the new normal. The crowd at pubs have also begun to increase gradually. I often go out with my friends and have a good time socialising. So, clubbing was the one thing I missed when the initial few lockdowns were announced. I just try to be careful and safe while going clubbing nowadays.
- Yashika Aannand, actress


‘After an hour at a pub, we return home & party’
People are bored at home and they want to have a change in atmosphere. But after a couple of drinks, people do not follow social
distancing. So, my friends and I go to pub for just an hour or so to experience the change in space, and then come home and turn the party into a BYOB (Bring Your Own Booze) one with some good food, after which we call it a night. That said, the safety measures at the Chennai pubs are quite spot-on. They are not overbooking to make a quick buck and that is a good thing.
- Karun Raman, fashion choreographer


‘The best things is guests themselves behave responsibly’
Even after we were allowed to open in September beginning, we reopened only two weeks later after ensuring that every safety protocol was in place. The good thing now is that the guests themselves act in a responsible manner. One day, when I invited one of our regular guests for an event, he told me he wasn’t
feeling well and said he would skip it. Even in the smoking area, they themselves maintain social distancing.
-Arun Praksah, partner, BOATS

‘It’ll take one year for things to be
normal in terms of nightlife’
Things are slowly starting to pick up, but I would still say that it will take a year’s time for things to be back to normal again where nightlife is concerned. The 10pm curfew does not help. There is a decent amount of crowd sitting and dining at the pubs. But dancing is something that not a lot of people want to indulge in because of the safety concerns. This is a concern for the bars as well, which are following protocols. That said, I have not resumed DJing in Chennai yet because of budget issues. Around 99 per cent of the properties are not willing to spend as much as they usually can on DJ right now as they are financially constrained.
- MAG X, DJ in Chennai


‘I see a lot many new faces and that’s encouraging’
On a comparative note from September to now, business is slowly picking up. The encouraging thing is I see a lot of new faces. For the pubs, December is the most important month. Every year, that’s when the maximum number of people step out for parties. The weather is good and people step out well dressed and hit the bar by 7pm and party late into the night. In this situation, it’ll be a new experience for both the guests as well as us.
- James G Prakash,
co-founder, Off The Record


‘We hope the govt eases up regulations from December’
The number of guests is picking up. The videos of all safety protocols, including from the kitchen, are shared on our social media pages. Our regular customers are back and there are new walk-ins, too. We are allowed to function with 50 per cent capacity and that’s full almost all weekends. We are abiding by all the SOPs given by the government, and we hope that a few regulations will be eased out by the first week of December.

'Some people don't take wearing masks seriously'


The party scene in Coimbatore seems to be picking up, albeit slowly. The clubs have opened and the tables are full on Saturday evenings. The crowd definitely is not like how it was before the lockdown. For a DJ, an engaging crowd makes a huge difference. But I guess, this is the new normal. I think people will be really looking forward to say goodbye to 2020, but we have to wait and watch if partying would be their top-most priority on New Year’s Eve. Meanwhile, one disappointing thing is that some of these party goers don’t take wearing masks seriously and do not respect the personal space and safety of others, especially when social distancing is a priority.

"  Nov 19, 2020, 00:00 IST",Vinay Lokesh,TV,Actors Darshak Gowda and Shilpa Ravi to wed on November 25,"Television actors Darshak Gowda and Shilpa Ravi have shared good news. The two of them will tie the knot on November 25, in Bengaluru. Keeping the current scenario in mind, the actors who got engaged last year, will be getting married in an intimate ceremony, that will be attended by their family members, friends and well-wishers.

Darshak Gowda, who has also acted Tamil serials, says, “We both used to work for the same channel. I first met her at an award ceremony, after that I got to know that Shilpa is my former colleague’s sister. That’s how our friendship continued for a year and then I took the initiative to propose to her directly for marriage, as at that time I was busy with my projects Padmavathi and Kanmani and I did not have time for dating. Shilpa did not have any objections to marry me, but she just wanted her parents' consent. I met her parents and spoke about our relationship to which they agreed and even my parents gave the nod to take our relationship to the next level. We are both excited to start a new phase of our lives.”


Talking about the wedding, the actor further tells us, “The marriage was supposed to happen in May, but was postponed to November because of the lockdown.” Currently, Darshak Gowda is seen in the serial Kavyanajali and Shilpa Ravi is acting in the soap opera Jeeva Hoovagide."

Now that Nikki Tamboli is forming a new bond with Kavita Kaushik, Eijaz Khan seems to be quite sure that she has come under the latter’s influence.
In the latest episode, Eijaz was seen doing the dishes since Nikki didn’t do it as a part of her duty. But as there is no captain she refuses to follow the duties. Eijaz told everyone about it, and this struck an argument between him and Nikki.

Eijaz further mimicked and mocked Nikki and demanded that everyone should punish her for not performing her duties. Nikki got agitated and announced that she would only do her own dishes from now on, and if required, she would even cook for herself.
Moreover, Nikki in her anger told Eijaz that his bad behaviour won’t work here and said “Tumhari Badtameezi na ghar pe dikhana, yahan nahi chalegi (Your unmannerliness would work at your home and not here.)” She also declared, “Tumko jo ukhaadna hai na Ukhaad lo (Do whatever you want to.)”


Eijaz got annoyed with Nikki and her words. The atmosphere got much more heated up when Nikki pointed out Eijaz’ broken arm which seemed to be working well in doing the dishes. She further exclaimed that he is playing ‘victim card’ in the show.


This did not go well with Eijaz, and he targeted Nikki’s new friend Kavita. He said that Nikki has found a new ‘naukar’ in her just like she found one in Jaan Kumar Sanu at the beginning. He also addressed Nikki as ‘joker' and Kavita as her 'cheli'.

From maintaining sanitization on the set to ensuring no one gets affected by the virus, filmmakers and production teams have a lot of responsibilities. While it’s relatively easier to shoot inside a controlled environment, like a studio, it’s all the more difficult to film at live locations, like city streets and villages. The team of Kaagitha Pookkal couldn’t agree more.

A source says, “Despite doing CVOID-19 tests for its entire cast and crew and obtaining necessary permissions to shoot at a village near Pollachi, the team wasn’t allowed entry by the villagers. They were apprehensive about contracting the coronavirus. Finally, director and producer Muthumanikkam, along with production in-charge Subramaniam had to station the team in Pollachi, travel to Sempatti village in Dindigul, obtain permission to shoot and then call his team over. The shoot is over and the movie is in its post-production stage.”


About the film, Muthumanikkam says, “A person’s lover can become another person’s wife. But someone’s wife can’t become someone else’s lover. What will happen if that situation arises? That’s what my film deals with. Debutant actors Logan and Priyadarshini play the lead in the film, while Praveen Kumar has an important role. Thavasi is also playing a crucial role in the film.”"

It gets hard to keep things interesting in a serious relationship, mainly because you both know each other’s preferences early on or can easily guess a surprise they are about to give. Once the honeymoon phase passes, it becomes almost boring and you carry on in your daily lives. The only difference being, that you both are now married. In such instances, your sex life takes a back-seat amongst all other priorities in a relationship.
Couples need to understand that sex is also very important to retain a marriage. The physical connection is as vital as the emotional one. So, in an account of this, we bring to you 7 couples who shared, how they kept their sex life alive.

1. “Believe it or not, we both decided to have sex in a public place every time we went on vacation. Be it the swimming pool in Bali or a private woods area in the States.”
Gaurav and Shreya
2. “We send our kids out to play or visit the mall every time we need some space to ourselves. It can get quite difficult to get on with sex with children there in the house. Now that they are old enough to go on their own, we enjoy some steamy time at home too!”
Nikhil and Mansi

3. “It’s been 8 years since we have been married. At first, having the whole house to ourselves seemed amazing because we could have sex anywhere! But, we got bored with it, until one day, my husband decided to treat me to a one-night stay at a fancy hotel in town. There were rose petals on the bed, champagne, oh it was majestic! Now, once in a while we always treat each other to a night of passion. It never gets old!”
Krittika and Vasu

4. “Every time we fight, we have made a pact to have sex that very night. So, even if you’re angry from the fight earlier, letting off the steam through sex can be a great idea. Fighting can be frustrating and so, sex can be the solution too! And of course, communication.”

Shahveer and Amalya

5. “We decided to finally buy Kamasutra, and it was a real-great find for our sex lives. We both also started yoga, and now we can explore different sex positions, flawlessly. Talk about being sexy in old age!”

Ritesh and Anjali

6. “One is never too old for beautiful lingerie! If you start believing that, then you’re already on it. Believe that you’re still as youthful as your 20s and surprise each other by buying lingerie or by decorating the room with a scented candle or two. It always works.”

Aditi and Utkarsh

7. “This is the good old advice. Keep your communication clear with your husband and wife. I always tell my wife what I like and dislike-in life and in the bedroom too. Once we start getting real with ourselves, our sex lives will also improve. Communication is vital.”

‘This is not the right time to think about a new relationship’

The actress, who is single currently, says that she is happy that way and the pandemic has given her time to introspect. She shares, “I pondered about life a lot during the lockdown. While I realize that most people felt lonely and scared due to singledom, I didn’t feel like that at all. In fact, I became closer to my family and worked on myself and my skills. I am not in a hurry to get into a relationship, as I never felt lonely. I had the love and support of my family. This is not the right time to think about a new relationship. We should focus on strengthening the bond that we already share with our family and friends.”

Talking exclusively to Bombay Times about it, Sandeep says, “We went out for a meal to an indoor restaurant with a friend in Goa. The host was super attentive, but we left early as the place began filling up. The owner tested positive the following Monday, so we suspect we caught it at the restaurant. On Tuesday, I had a slight fever and then Abu got a fever too, so we decided to get tested. The tests had to be sent to Mumbai and it took three days for the results. We were absolutely shocked to find that all three of us tested positive for the virus.”

Abu adds, “We had low-grade fever for three days. Since we were asymptomatic, apart from the fever and oxygen levels, the Goa authorities approved us to home quarantine. Mild is a relative term , it isn’t a happy viral to have. The worst is the complete sapping of energy, our bodies hurt and felt like lead.”
When asked about dealing with COVID-19, Sandeep says, “We were blessed to be together and at home and battled corona with a lot of rest, good nutrition and positive energy. We are much better now, but are taking it easy. None of us know the long-term effects of COVID, so one must take care, be zealous about check-ups and not overdo it with work or exercise.” Abu adds, “Weakness is a part of COVID, so please don’t fight your low energy levels. Allow your body the time it needs to heal. We used the time to catch up with reading and watching classics, shows and series online.”


The duo advises everyone to take precaution during this pandemic situation. “Avoid indoor places that are crowded including restaurants, elevators and marketplaces. Take all the precautions you can to protect yourselves and others,” they say.


Having completed 34 years in the world of fashion, Abu-Sandeep are known for their seamless blending of traditional Indian craftsmanship with modern silhouettes; they have dressed many Bollywood stars, including the Bachchan family for years. During the pandemic, they also supported the movement to sustain local artisans.



The duo, who call themselves ‘natural born workaholics’, used the quarantine to do what they do best: work. “We are total movie buffs and have now decided to create and not merely watch. We set up a mini-idea think tank at home and brainstormed on ideas for our movie company,"" they inform."

This will mean Virat will miss a chunk of the all-important tour of Australia that begins next month. Three years ago, Amit – who was working with a foreign bank then – had availed of a two-week paternity leave, missing out on an important work conference. “I prioritised my family. Many found it absurd that I would miss an important work conference for it. I probably let go of a promotion opportunity as a result. But it didn’t matter,” Amit tells us.
Kohli’s decision of availing paternity leave has earned both praise and criticism from fans. While some are commending him for being with his wife during such an important time of their life, others have said he is in “dereliction of national duty” as he is leaving an important series for personal matters. This has reignited the debate regarding paternity leave in India, with a focus on its prevalence, acceptance and support through corporate policies.

No laws governing paternity leave
Unlike maternity leave, there is no law governing leave for fathers in India. A Paternity Benefit Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha by MP Rajeev Satav in 2017. The bill, which emphasises upon equal parental benefits for both parents, proposes that all workers, including those in the unorganised and private sector, can avail paternity leave of 15 days, extendable up to three months. However, the bill has not yet been passed by the Parliament.
The government made provisions for paternity leave for all public sector employees in 1999 through the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rule 551 (A). This allows any male central government employee (including trainees and probationers) with less than two children to avail a 15-day paternity leave either 15 days before or within six months from the date of delivery of child.

Leave duration varies from 5 days to 26 weeks in India
Paternity leave is a rather new concept in the Indian corporate setup and most companies have started offering it in the last few years. There is no set time duration for paternity leave in corporate India. Public sector employees get 15-day paternity leave and many companies have adopted the same model. Most multinational companies have brought in the same policies that exist in their global offices to India. For instance, tech giants Facebook, Deloitte and Microsoft offer their employees 17, 16 and 12 weeks of paternity leave respectively. Last year, food aggregator Zomato made waves after rolling out a 26-week paternity leave for its employees. This is among the highest duration of paternity leaves in India. But this is not the norm. Most companies offer paternity leave between 5-15 days.

Adil Nargolwala, a senior HR executive with an MNC in Gurgaon, says, “In today’s world with nuclear families working couples don’t have the luxury of large joint family setups. Therefore, the husband/father needs to get time off from work to take care of his wife and newborn child. Organisations today recognise this and have paternity leave as well as paternity allowances for their male employees. The duration, etc obviously varies from company to company depending on how progressive their human resource policies are, size and other factors. In such organisations, the process of availing paternity leave is similar to any other, in fact, as the birth of a baby is a known event and it can be planned well in advance.”

Has the mindset changed regarding availing of paternity leave in India?
In 2015, when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared that he would be availing a two-month paternity leave, it was still a novel concept. Since then, a lot has changed across the world. Yet, India remains among the 90 out of the 187 countries in the world that do not have national policies to ensure that new fathers get adequate paid time off with their babies. Are corporates and their employees in India prepared to embrace the evolving role of fathers in families?
Men who have availed of paternity leave in the past say the attitudes regarding it have certainly changed, of late. “It wasn’t easy asking for paternity leave when my first child was born in 2009. I was laughed at by my colleagues. The management asked me why I wanted to take leave for ‘this long’ when I requested a two-week leave. It was considered excessive. That mindset has changed now. A junior availed of a one-month paternity leave last year and nobody batted an eyelid,” says Zaheer Khan, a BPO executive from Delhi.
Kabir*, an IT professional from Bangalore, who took a 10-day paternity leave in January this year, says, “My company didn’t have paternity leave but my manager and the HR gave me leave under a special provision in a way that I was paid and didn’t lose any of my saved leaves too. Many companies do it nowadays.”
However, it hasn’t changed completely, some argue. Nikhil Sharma*, an IT professional from Noida, tells us, “The mindset that child-raising is not something men need to concern themselves with exists today as well. Even though several companies have progressive policies, the people executing them are still rigid. Last year, I faced much ridicule over the fact that I wanted to extend my 12-day paternity leave to over a month. My wife and I live alone and I was the only one who could have been there for her. Despite knowing that, my seniors forced me to take work from home and not a long leave. Statements like ‘what do you need a leave for when she has taken a maternity leave?’ were thrown at me.”


For many men, the worry that a six-month break may become a career setback, is quite real. New mothers often find it difficult to get integrated in the workforce afterwards. In our social set-up, where men are still considered the “breadwinner”, men may not be comfortable availing paternity leave.

Some say the absence of a law to support it, unlike the maternity leave, contributes to the paternity leave needs not being taken seriously. Gursimran Singh*, a management executive with a consultancy firm in Delhi, says, “My wife was able to take a six-month paid maternity leave easily as that is mandated by law. All companies must have provisions for it. But my company and management made me feel as if they were doing me a favour by granting me 15-day paternity leave. Even though the provision exists, their attitude was as if they were being charitable. It could be because the law doesn’t require a company to grant paternity leave. So, they see it as superfluous.”

" Nov 19, 2020, 15:54 IST",Onkar Kulkarni,Entertainment,Exclusive! Chitrangda Singh: I know the feeling of living life as a girl with dusky complexion,"Chitrangda Singh has always been vocal about the general obsession that a vast section of Indians have with fair skin. Some time ago, the actress even took to social media to express that she’s ‘brown n happy’. In an interview with Bombay Times, she recalls the stigma she faced over her skin colour while growing up. “I know the feeling of living life as a girl with dusky complexion. This is not something that people will say directly to your face. You can only sense it. I have been through the biases, especially while growing up in the north. So, with my post, I just wanted to say that one needs to feel beautiful in their own skin,” she says.

Chitrangda has lived across various regions in India, including Rajasthan, UP and Delhi before she came to

Mumbai. Ask her if she faced discrimination owing to her skin colour when she ventured into showbiz, and she is quick to add, “I did lose out on modelling assignments. In fact, when I lost out on one ad in the initial days of my

career, I was specifically told the reason as it had come down to selecting between two people for the part. Luckily, the audition that I did for a product was seen by Gulzar saab, who got me on board for his music video. I realised that not everybody goes out looking for white-skinned people here.”

The actress, whose last release was the Saif Ali Khan-starrer Baazaar, will next be seen in Bob Biswas, which is a thriller. The film also features Abhishek Bachchan, about whom she says, “He is a walking encyclopedia. I had no idea he is so knowledgeable and well-informed. It is so much fun working with him.”"

So, it is no wonder that performing artiste Diya Naidu has chosen to tap into these two feelings for her latest work - Ceremony Of Longing. Diya, who has choreographed the performance, shares that it is a performative ceremony, to be conducted on November 20, as her first live performance in months.

""The piece has been performed by four dancers - Maitreyee Joshi, Snigdha Prabhakar, Paridhi Bihani and me. We had an Open House at Ranga Shankara recently, where we put out a call for stories and chose four to be performed in a ritualistic way. We wanted to work on a piece that brought forth aspirations, given the current situation all of us are in. Through this performance, we wanted to uncover the longing, and the yearning and what we want in our lives,"" says Diya, adding, ""There is a lot of dance, chanting and storytelling that has been woven into the performance.""


Why is it called a performative ceremony, though? ""A lot of people reject spiritual and inner work due to various reasons and religion has often been misused, but there is something in all of us that connects with the divine energy. All of us are communicating with something that's larger than life. The ceremony is that manifestation point of a journey that was taken. So, through this performance, we look at the journey of the past five weeks, that has gone into making this performance happen and the stories that have made this journey possible,"" she says, adding ""All of this will come together as a ceremony, which will be witnessed by the audience. We will have an installation towards the end. Audiences will be able to see all our longing woven together in a physical form when we reveal it to them."""

Experts list a few concoctions to aid in digestion and improve your gut health.
Detox water/ tea
Ingredients
1 litre of water

1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon freshly chopped ginger
Method
Combine all the ingredients in 1 litre of water and boil for 3-4 minutes. Filter the solution and store in a bottle. Drink this concoction through the day.
""This concoction helps to remove toxins from the colon and digestive tracts. In Ayurveda, we call the toxins formed from overeating and indigestion as ama and this helps clean the digestive tract and aid digestion,"" says Ayurvedacharya Dr Partap Chauhan.

Ginger mint tea
Ingredients
1 inch piece of fresh ginger
3-4 peppermint leaves
¼ lemon
Method
Bring about 500 ml water to boil. Add ginger and 3-4 peppermint leaves. Reduce to half, then add a few drops of lemon juice and consume warm.
""The ginger in this tea helps reduce gastritis and inflammation. The peppermint reduces acid and excess digestive heat. In combination, peppermint and lemon reduce bloating and water retention in the stomach, while peppermint and ginger help ease constipation and detoxification,"" says holistic nutritionist Shikha Mahajan.

Spiced Tea

1 inch piece stick of cinnamon
½ teaspoon cumin

½ teaspoon saunf or fennel seeds

a few leaves of parsley

Cumin and fennel are both helpful in reducing excess acid and gas, and easing stomach cramps. Parsley is exceptionally useful in reducing water retention,"" says Shikha.


Keep it light while on detox

""Since you are going for a detox and looking at cleaning or removing toxins from your digestive tract, have light food items. You could have fruit for breakfast and a proper meal at lunchtime. For dinner, have vegetable soup or moong dal khichdi. Also, try to indulge in some physical activity like a walk, run, stretching or yoga. Avoid cold drinks and junk food. Dairy products are not a good idea when you are on detox,"" says Dr Partap."
"  Nov 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",Madhu Daithota,TV,"Even though the CCB summoned 700 people in the drug scandal interrogation, the media focused only on a few: Akul Balaji","Two months after he was summoned by the CCB for enquiry in the Sandalwood drug case, actor and television personality Akul Balaji is finally in a frame of mind to speak about the episode. “I went off the radar after that, not out of guilt, but because I was hurt — owing to the unjust speculation that was rife about me in the media and the whole thing being blown out of proportion,” shares Akul. When he received the call from the authorities, Akul says he was in shock. “I assured my family that all would be fine, as I had the necessary documents as proof and would co-operate with the authorities by sharing the true picture. But the toughest phase was when I came out. I had six channels chasing me all the way to the airport, with cameras being thrust in my face at every signal. The home and farm house that I had built with my hard-earned money were portrayed like places where drugs were free flowing. The name that I had made in the past decade was being torn to shreds, making me seem like a criminal. The CCB summoned 700 people. But the media chose to highlight a select few for TRPs,” he says.

His wife Jo and son Krish were extremely affected, observes Akul. “Krish looked up the issue on the internet probably because his friends mentioned something about me. He asked me what the issue was about. I spoke to him and he was okay after that. Nobody realises the agony we go through in this whole melee of grabbing eyeballs with sensational news,” avers Akul.

The entire episode, he adds, has taught him to face things head on and has made him more resilient. “I’m looking forward to going back on the set now and resuming work. And I have to thank Kichcha Sudeep who stood like a rock behind me during this period and offering me precious advice,” Akul sums up"

They will be seen together in SD Vijay Milton's as-yet-untitled Kannada directorial debut. This film also stars Dhananjaya, Pruthvi Ambaar and Umashree.

Talking about the casting coup, filmmaker Krishna Sarthak, who is backing the film, says, ""We are thrilled to have Shashikumar sir on board for the film. He will be playing a pivotal role and will be seen alongside Shivarajkumar throughout the film. Their combination is definitely going to be something that everyone will enjoy.""

Shivarajkumar and Shashikumar were last seen together in the 2001 release Bahala Channagide. The actors had regaled the audiences in the 1990s when they were contemporaries and their collaboration in this film is seen as a major casting coup.

The team of this film has made it to reinstall the ideas and values of great gurus and a respect for our culture among the younger generation,” says Prathama, who plays Aryamba, the mother of Shankaracharya.

“I feel fortunate to be playing that role, because it was immortalised by the late LV Sharada Rao in GV Iyer’s film,” says Prathama, adding, “It was a challenging role, because it’s a period film, so, your mannerisms have to be different from commercial films. Also, Aryamba was widowed at a young age and raised a child alone. From a young mother to an old woman and finally exiting life in this world, I’ve enacted varied emotions in these phases.”


The film has been directed by Raja Ravi, and shot in places like Sringeri, Sirsi, Melkote and some parts of Kerala to lend authenticity."
"  Nov 20, 2020, 00:00 IST",M Suganth,Entertainment,Aruna Sairam recorded her first film song all by herself during lockdown in the US,"Carnatic singer Aruna Sairam has sung her first film song in the recent film Mookuthi Amman, starring RJ Balaji and Nayanthara. But what’s interesting about this number is that the singer, who was in the US, had to record the song all by herself, with guidance from the film’s composer Girishh Gopalakrishnan and his team virtually, during the lockdown.

“The song is a rousing number that comes as a lead to the climax of the film. We have had such songs in commercial cinema, like Maduraveeran Thaane in Dhool. But we wanted to do a song that felt divine,” begins Girishh.

They had already done a spiritual song as folk number for the film, sung by LR Eswari, and wanted a song that was in contrast to it. During the film’s editing, they felt the Aigiri Nandini stotram would work very well for this particular situation. “If LR Eswari amma is the authority for folksy Amman songs, then, Aruna ji’s is the gold standard for Aigiri Nandini, like how MS (Subbulakshmi) Amma’s voice is associated with Suprabhatam,” states the composer.
When they reached out to the singer, she was in the US, where she had gone for a tour in February, but had been forced to stay back because of the pandemic.
Aruna Sairam, who is presently in the UK, tells us, “I felt a good vibe after I heard the title, because this is a powerful Amman. And when I listened to the story, I felt it was relevant in today’s times, and liked the direction in which the team was taking such a story. Musically, too, the song was what I was comfortable with.”

Aruna wanted to learn the song and perform it well. But then, due to personal reasons, she couldn’t record the song even after a month. The team decided to try one last time, and the singer said she might be able to record the song, but then, they would have to do it in the next 48 hours, owing to her personal situation. However, this was in the midst of the shutdown due to the pandemic in the US.

Girishh managed to find a recording studio in Seattle, but Aruna, who was in Mercer Island, on the suburbs of Seattle, could not leave home because she was in the high-risk category. They decided to find an alternative. All that was needed was a laptop, mic and sound card, which they had to then deliver to Aruna’s residence. Through actor Karthik Kumar, for whose film he is composing the music, Girishh managed to get in touch with the producer of Vellai Pookal, Dhiga Sekaran. Dhiga put him in touch with Vellai Pookal’s music director Ramgopal Krishnaraju, who had a spare mic and sound card, but no laptop.

Finally, Swathi Ravichandran, a Facebook friend of Girishh, who he has never met, but had moved recently to Seattle, loaned her laptop. But they needed a person to get all these to Aruna’s house, and they had already lost quite some time trying to source the equipment.

Meanwhile, the clock was ticking. In the end, the composer reached out to his cousin, Sabarish, to be the deliverer. Collecting and delivering all the equipment would take another three hours, cutting further into their time to record the song.

Finally, there was the technical nightmare of getting Aruna, who was living all alone at that time, to set up the equipment and record the song – which is usually done by trained sound engineers — all over Zoom calls.

“Setting up the makeshift recording booth all by myself was challenging for me as I’m not that familiar with the technology. The team already had quite a task to even coordinate and deliver the equipment to my doorstep. But all through, Girishh remained hopeful, and his positive vibe kept us all going,” says Aruna.

Obviously, there were problems, with the team not able to get the singer’s feed at their recording studio here in Chennai. Despite trying everything, things weren’t working out, and the time window that Aruna had given them was closing in. They were almost ready to call the whole thing off, but decided to try one last time. And luckily, one team member realised it was a firewall that was blocking the signal from Aruna’s system from coming to their studio, and they fixed it up.


In the next two hours, the team recorded a version of Aigiri Nandini with Aruna Sairam and also got her to record a Tamil version as well, written by Pa Vijay, in an equivalent old Tamil, taking inspiration from Abhirami Andhadhi.

“She performed just like how she would at a concert. She went over every little detail, and even wanted to do retakes for portions, which she wasn’t happy with. The irony was that the actual recording took just two hours while setting up the whole thing took more than five hours! Nevertheless, it was a great experience, and we have to thank Aruna ji for it. She was super patient, learning everything with enthusiasm and not getting worked up over the hassles that she was going through,” praises Girishh.


“The feedback that I’ve been getting for the song has been wonderful, and I was told that even the BBC radio had played it on one of their stations in the UK. Given the stakes involved, I’m glad the song is getting this kind of recognition,” signs off Aruna."

"  Nov 20, 2020, 00:12 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Ayushmann Khurrana: Children who grow up seeing and experiencing violence often perpetuate violence,"Ayushmann Khurrana took to his social media account on Wednesday to talk about putting an end to violence against children. The actor, currently shooting for Abhishek Kapoor’s next in Chandigarh, has been appointed as UNICEF’s Celebrity Advocate for their global campaign that aims to fight violence against kids. On World Children’s Day today, the actor, while chatting with BT, underlined the need to protect kids, who have become more vulnerable to violence due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“COVID-19 has not been easy for anyone, especially children. It has made them more vulnerable to violence. We can prevent this by being aware and protecting those around us. And as men and boys, we have a responsibility to be better role models because we know, often, it is we men who are perpetrators of violence. As UNICEF’s celebrity advocate, I am committed to ending violence against children,” he says.


According to the National Crime Records Bureau (2018), every hour, five cases of child sexual abuse are reported in India. The National Family Health Survey-4 reveals that one out of every five adolescent girls experiences physical violence from the age of 15, and 99 per cent school children are subjected to physical and mental abuse by teachers (according to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, 2012).

“Children deserve to live free from violence. Children’s rights are human rights. Violence has terrible consequences for children, affecting them physically and mentally. The effects can last an entire lifetime and can destroy a child’s chance to live a happy, healthy life. They’re subjected to violence in so many places — at home, in school, on the move, on the streets, online and in the community. It happens in both wealthy and low-income families. Often, the perpetrators are those that children trust,” says Ayushmann.


He adds, “Violence against children is often not reported. Children don’t speak up and parents, even if they know, may not report it. Sexual abuse is often accompanied by stigma, hence children and parents shy away from reporting the cases. Children who grow up seeing and experiencing violence often perpetuate violence. As actors and public figures, we attract a lot of attention and are therefore in a position to put the spotlight on the needs of children. I hope to use my passion and commitment to increasing public awareness about children’s issues, advocate for children, especially the vulnerable ones, and support UNICEF’s mission to ensure every child’s right to live free from violence.”"

"  Nov 20, 2020, 00:12 IST",,TV,Bigg Boss 14: Eijaz Khan and Pavitra Punia get into a heated argument; the latter warns the former to not play these tricks with her,"Bigg Boss 14 has surprised the audience with each of its twists and turns, and it is not just the concept of the show but the changing equations in between the housemates that at times surprise and at many times shocks the audiences and keep them wondering about the true friendships that exist in the show.
In the latest episode, the captaincy task became a reason for multiple clashes as well as revelations. The task required the participation of only all the previous captains of the house who included Jasmin Bhasin, Aly Goni, Kavita Kaushik and Eijaz Khan. The participants had to stay inside a box and who stays the longest would win to become the next captain. And as per Bigg Boss’ instructions, Eijaz couldn’t play himself since he had an injured shoulder.

Pavitra Punia chose to represent Eijaz in the task. In the turn of events, Eijaz in a way gave up on the task when he lifted his box from Pavitra after getting to know that Rahul Vaidya who was named as the ‘sanchalak’ has his preference towards Jasmin.
Eijaz faced the backlash of his friends for his decision, especially from Jaan Kumar Sanu who blamed him for not supporting him ever in the game when he came to know that the latter had plans to save Rubina and not him.

Later Jaan straightaway asked Eijaz if he had thought of saving him from the nominations if he became the captain, and had discussed it with Pavitra or not. To which Eijaz said that he had no such discussion with Pavitra, but he would have surely saved him.

Pavitra retorted saying that she had told him that they have to save Jaan from the nominations. Eijaz didn't agree. This led to a heated argument between both of them.


Amidst the heated argument, Pavitra said to Eijaz, “Mere muh pe jhoot bol rahe ho (You’re lying to my face.)” She further told Eijaz to not play this kind of a game with her and try such tricks on someone else, when Eijaz tried to recall and remind her of the chain of events.


Moreover, Eijaz told Pavitra that she is doing all this to create a good and positive image of herself in front of Jaan and everyone else. He stated that she is trying to insinuate that she wanted him to save Jaan, but he didn’t.

"  Nov 20, 2020, 01:00 IST",,Lifestyle,DECODED: How brown fat can protect against obesity and diabetes,"Fat accumulation in the body has always been considered bad for health. But to your surprise, not all kinds of fat are bad. Out of the five different types of fat generally present in the human body, brown fat is considered a healthy fat. Also known as good fat, brown fat is a special type of body fat that produces heat to help maintain your body temperature in cold conditions. It acts as a built-in heater and keeps us warm when the temperature drops. Activated by cool temperatures, brown fat uses sugar and fat from the blood to generate heat. They are generally present in small quantities in areas like neck, collarbone, kidneys and spinal cord. Apart from this, the latest study revealed that brown fat can also protect against obesity and diabetes, the major health concern that has engulfed the entire globe.
What does the recent study suggest?
As per a study published in the journal Nature, these kinds of fat can help in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The findings revealed that brown fat could help the body filter and remove branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) from the blood. When present in a normal amounts, these amino acids are essential for good health but an increase in its level is linked to diabetes and obesity. This study suggests that people with low or no brown fat have difficulty in clear BCAAs from their blood, which later lead to the development of obesity and diabetes.


How to increase the percentage of brown fat in the body
There are several ways to boost your levels of brown fat to maintain healthy body weight and decrease the risk of diabetes. Here are the four most effective ways to do so.

Exercise: As per a study published in the Disease Models and Mechanisms, exercising triggers the release of an enzyme called irisin that helps white fat cells to convert to brown.


Turn down the temperature: Exposure to the cold temperature may even help to boost more brown fat in the body. As per some research, daily two hours of exposure to temperatures around 66˚F (19˚C) may help to increase the level of brown fat in the body.


Eat frequently: A key rule to stay healthy is to have food in small quantities at regular intervals. Starving yourself will make you more prone to developing health issues like obesity. Eat healthy food, at regular intervals and limited quantities can encourage white fat to turn brown.


Eat an apple every day: An apple a day not only keeps the doctor away but also helps to increase the level of brown fat in the body. A study carried out by the researchers at the University of Iowa found that ursolic acid, which is found in apple peels can help to increase the percentage of brown fat in the body."

"  Nov 21, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Entertainment,Bengaluru band 1Fret Away gears up to release its debut album,"Bengaluru-based band 1Fret Away is all set to release their debut album, I'm Not A Metal Head, in two parts. The band comprises Vinay Balodi, Arwen M.A.G.M.A and Simran Fathima. Side A of the album, which will be released on November 26, consists of five songs.

Talking about the album, lead vocalist Arwen says, ""Though we are a 13-year-old band, we have been working on the album for the past four years. Bringing in the flavour of choirs and background vocals, synths and strings took time. We added orchestral effects to the songs and built them up to where they are now, making them more melodic in the genre of alternate rock,"" says Arwen, adding, ""In addition to this, the band line-up kept changing through the years and we kept performing a lot of live gigs as well. Hence, it took time. But the lockdown was one of the best things that happened to us as a band. We got five songs ready in four months.""


The album, which falls under the punk rock genre, will be released in two parts and audiences can expect fun and love songs. ""Side A of the album is an approach to rock dancing. It's alternate music and the songs have a happy vibe that people can dance to. Three songs are love songs, and one, titled Velocity, is a fast track that one can jump and dance to. The Metal Song is the band anthem and these are the oldest songs in the album. We have performed them live during our gigs. The anthem is a rhetorical and humorous track,"" Arwen shares."

After months of no operations, cinema halls in the city opened doors amid strict safety protocols in October and only 50 per cent capacity, and playing films that already had theatrical runs. This week, though, that changed, with several new releases across languages hitting theatres, one of which revived the premiere night concept on Thursday. Sixty lucky movie buffs got to catch the first show of a new film in town at a city multiplex. Organised by Rubin Raj, the event was conducted in keeping with safety measures. “Although the hall has a seating capacity of 157, we invited only 60 to be a part of this show. At the entrance, the name of each guest was noted down, along with the temperature check reading. They would then be asked to sanitise their hands before heading to the screening hall,” said Rubin.

We spotted several families on this outing, most of who professed to have not only missed the experience of watching a film on the big screen, but also the treats from the food counters."

"  Nov 21, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,I am addicted to so many of Anirudh’s songs: Ramya Raj,"After releasing singles like Nothin’ Matters, Seruvoma and Mango Lassi, US-based independent artiste Ramya Raj is out with her new single, Bodhai Neeye. An intense love song with a dash of rap, the young musician talks about how the song happened, her music journey and why she wants to sing for Anirudh. Excerpts:

Tell us about your single, Bodhai Neeye...
Bodhai Neeye is the craziest passion project I’ve ever done because it literally changed my life in more ways than one. I wrote the song in February 2019 and the track just came together quite seamlessly. It’s funny how this is a pretty ‘intense’ love song, but I am very much single (smiles). But jokes apart, I knew I wanted the track to be a fun number with a dancehall vibe to get people jamming, since my previous track Seruvoma was a breakup rap song, with a sombre vibe. Soon, I laid down the tune and worked with a sound engineer to get the beat made, recorded the vocals, and bam the track was done. After the song was born, I knew I had to get a music video made, because obviously it helps people engage and I personally love storytelling and acting. So, I shot a little video with a couple of my friends. But the music label I’d contacted wanted me to fly down to Chennai to shoot a music video for the song as they wanted to take a different stab at it visually. Since I’m from the US and had a job, and was going to start my MBA, I had think about it. But I convinced my parents about making a quick trip to Chennai, bought the tickets and had the opportunity to shoot a music video here, in August 2019. The video was shot and edited, but the team and I felt that though the visuals were stunning it really had no connection to the lyrics and the vibe of the song. So, we were in discussion on how to go about releasing the song and decided that re-shooting would be the only option. Finally, in June 2020 we came to the agreement that I could just reshoot the video here in the US. I am so glad to have got my co-star Erik for the song as well.


When did you begin your musical journey?
Ever since I was little, I’ve been singing and writing songs. I used to bag the solos in school musicals and sang in a couple of bands in the summer when I was in high school. I also took piano lessons and teaching myself the Uke. But I think I was eight years old when I found myself being intrigued to write and share my songs rather than singing what already existed, whether that was in Tamil or in English. As a little kid, I thought it was strange that music in India was all connected to the film industry and music didn’t stand alone. It was my goal for a while to introduce the idea of being an independent artiste, but then Hiphop Tamizha beat me to it. I was only like 14 and was obviously in the US so I couldn’t compete with him on that one (laughs). But I started to get into rap more seriously like six years ago and had my first Tamil rap single come out, last January. My goal is to make more English tracks, and to connect with more people without a language barrier. I’m literally just starting to share my music with the world and once I can gain the support of an army, that’s when I’ll know I’ve made it. But I am grateful for the little wins of having people message me talking about how much they enjoy my songs.

So, do you listen to Tamil music?
I have grown up listening to Tamil music, with my parents playing Ilaiyaraaja classics to Tamil gospel hits at home and in the car. Tamil music is definitely a safe place and hits differently. I have a very choosy ear, though, so the stuff I end up loving stays with me for life. I would love to compose for a Tamil film someday and either sing or rap for Anirudh. I am addicted to so many of his songs, so who knows maybe he’ll see this (laughs).


What are your upcoming projects?
I have quite a few English tracks that I’ll be dropping in 2021. The next Tamil song is drastically different from Bodhai Neeye. So, I am anxious to see how the response will be. I hope everyone will continue to support my endeavours and follow me along on my journey through social media."

Nikki and Rahul were discussing the captaincy task when they thought of a hypothetical situation, and Nikki said if Rubina would have been a part of this task, she would have been her preference. According to her, Rubina’s captaincy would turn out to be interesting because nobody would listen to her, and she would stick to the rules and want the same from all the housemates too.

This discussion between them followed with how Rubina keeps dominating hubby Abhinav and does not let him make his own decisions. She said, “Tujhe pata hai kitna dominate karti hai uske pati ko, aaj uspe chilla rahi thi (She dominates her husband a lot and was even shouting at him today.)”
Nikki further talked about how she witnessed Abhinav and Rubina’s argument that day, and she asked Abhinav to stop talking as soon as she entered by saying ‘Silence’. She added, “Bohot leti hai yaar uski, aur wo chup bhi baith jata hai (She always keeps telling him what to do and he even listens to it quietly.)”


Rahul agreed to what she was saying and said, “Usko bolne hi nahi deti hai (She doesn’t let him talk.)” Nikki added to this and said that she sometimes even insults him on his face.


Moreover, it was a day full of disputes between Rubina and Abhinav. Since Rubina wanted to participate in the captaincy task, Abhinav wanted her to keep calm and just watch. This led to some heated discussions between the couple.

As an actor, he has been cautious about not repeating himself in his films.

He recently made a cameo appearance in Basanti, a dance number also picturised on Manoj Bajpai and Karishma Tanna in the film, Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari. “Shruti Mahajan, who cast the film, wanted me to play a part but I couldn’t swing in the dates at that time. Then, she called me to be a part of this dance number. It’s a pleasant turn of events that I am eventually in the film, thanks to her, and director Abhishek Sharma who really wanted me to feature in the song. I agreed to do the cameo because I really cherish adding these little nuggets of knowledge and experience to my kitty. I also wondered ki main kya karunga gaane mein, how will I pull it off,” recalls Abhishek, adding, “We shot the song last year, around this time. It took us two days to wrap it up. I know Karishma, she’s a trained dancer. I told her she would have to help me with the moves. I’ve worked with Manoj sir before. But this time, he was unrecognisable on the set. I loved how confident he was in his skin playing the part and doing the moves. Watching Manoj sir in his detective avatar gave me a lot of confidence to pull off the song. Of course, the choreographer and I share an equation which also helped but it was Manoj sir who lit up the atmosphere with his turn.”"

Recently, he lashed out against trolls in his video blog on social media. An interview with a website was rehashed by other media and Sonu spoke up when he felt that his lines and sentiment were twisted and used.
Speaking to Bombay Times exclusively, Sonu explained that it was just a simple interview by a journalist that was later twisted. He said, “It was a very warm and positive conversation with the interviewer who very sweetly inquired about whether I am working on creating a singer out of my son. I have a template answer for most but this time I elaborated to her as to why I think I shouldn't force him to be something that I want him to become.”

Talking about his 13-year-old son, Nevaan, Sonu said, “Nevaan is a very wise and positive soul with diverse talents from painting to gaming to music to film directing and editing. He is also more into Western music. I don't intend to create another Nepo kid in the business purposely, unless he himself is engulfed with the desire to pursue music. Not my decision for him. Outside India, he'll be making a fresh start, on his own terms. Currently he's unofficially the number 2 gamer of the game Fortnite in the entire Emirates. I'd rather be a father who's encouraging his child in following his passion than someone austere and imposing my ideas of his future.”
Sonu added, “I wasn't coaxed into music by my parents. I was one of the toppers of my school and active in all other activities. Music, later, became my own choice of career and my parents wholeheartedly supported me to pursue my passion which had by then turned into prayer. And instead of appreciating the modern and sensible parenting approach of today's parents like me, some news articles stooped to a new low by not just actually quoting the lowest of trolls who have neither the standing nor the common sense to reason, but also glamorized them. Thus it was important to expose the miscreants in the garb of news providers.”"

To begin with, the actress was excited about doing up the apartment she had bought in Bandra. However, the pandemic struck, and along with the rest of the country, her plans, too, went into lockdown mode. However, now with things gradually getting back to normal, the actress has revived her dream-home project. Rakul says, “My house was almost ready when the lockdown was announced. I worked on the decor during the initial days of the lockdown, but I had ordered a lot of things for the house from across the world, and I had to cancel all those deliveries. Right after the lockdown was lifted, I didn’t get the time needed to give my home the final touches. I require a few days’ break to do that.”

Talking to us earlier, Rakul had shared her reason for buying a house in Mumbai. “When I moved back to this city during the shoot of De De Pyaar De (2019), I wasn’t sure how much time I would be spending here. But, soon, I realised that I would be staying here for long, and wanted a place that I could call ‘home’,” she had said, adding that the pad would reflect her style statement.


“The house has to be roomy with lots of open space. Soft pastel is my go-to colour palette. I want my home to be a calming space that can help me feel relaxed the moment I walk in. Also, I need to maintain a certain fluidity of thought in the décor scheme. Even if it’s a painting, it won’t be something too jarring. Everything has to merge into each other seamlessly. Lots of greenery is another must. The balcony is my favourite corner of the house. I love sitting there and reading, without any disturbance,” she had shared."

"  Nov 21, 2020, 01:00 IST",Anushka.Goel@timesgroup.com,Lifestyle,Kitchen gardening amid the pandemic? Try your hand at growing microgreens,"In the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, as people spent more time at home than ever, many took to gardening. In the months following the lockdown, social media was full of netizens’ successful (and unsuccessful) attempts at growing shimla mirch, mirchi and paalak, while some shared shots of their beautifully trimmed gardens. However, if you’re done growing plants and can’t figure out what to move on to, here’s an option – grow yourself some microgreens.

‘Microgreens are among the easiest to grow’
Quick and easy to grow, they are super nutritious as well. Says Bithika Gupta, an entrepreneur from Vasant Kunj, “Microgreens are among the easiest to grow. Even kids can do it, even those without green fingers can do it. You get the joy of growing plants, and you eat them, too.” You essentially eat an entire plant when consuming microgreens, instead of a part of the plant (like coriander or spinach leaves), which makes them more nutritious than adult plants, say experts.


‘Microgreens can be grown on window sills and dining tables’ Growing microgreens at home is quite easy, say experts and home gardeners. “They can be grown on window sills and dining tables, in old namkeen or food trays,” says Sangeeta Aggarwal, a Rajendra Park resident who conducts workshops on growing microgreens, adding that one should ensure that their seeds or grains that they are cultivating into microgreens are not coated with pesticides. Tanvi Agarwal, co-founder, Bombay Greens, which sells DIY microgreen kits, adds, “Since microgreens require little space to grow, you can densely pack the seeds into your growing medium.”

To grow microgreens, you need a container of some sort, and experts say any food takeaway tray works fine. “I grow my microgreens in a jaali wali basket (the kind vegetable vendors use), and they grow really healthy,” says Sudha Narain, an alternate therapist from Kolkata. She keeps her baskets in a plate full of water. “This method of watering the microgreens, where the water is provided from the bottom as compared to spraying it on the surface of the growing medium or plant, is called the bottom-watering method. It waters the plant evenly and prevents the growth of fungus,” explains Avanee Jain, founder, Upaj, which sells DIY microgreen growing kits. However, you should ensure that your container has drainage holes, says Sangeeta.



‘Ensure that the growing medium is moist’

What the growing medium should be used? Coconut coir, cocopeat, cotton or even wet paper towels work, say experts. “Since the seeds only require water, cocopeat or coconut coir is a good medium to grow microgreens – that is what I use, too,” says Bithika. Tanvi adds, “Coconut coir is the best medium to grow microgreens as it is sterile from any pests or fungi.”

“Once you sprinkle your seeds on the growing medium, keep it in the dark for three-four days, to allow the seeds to germinate,” says Sangeeta. After that, keep them on a window sill, away from direct sunlight. Ensure that the growing medium is moist, and your microgreens should be ready within a week or so. “I alternate between trays, growing one tray in a week so that I have a regular supply of microgreens,” says Bithika, adding, “What you are doing is recycling your takeaway or other containers, which repurposes them. Once your batch of microgreens is used up. you can toss your cocopeat into compost and reuse your container for a fresh batch.” Sudha uses the waste from her microgreens, ie, the roots, etc that haven’t been consumed, to make compost or bio-enzymes. “The bio-enzymes can be used to clean surfaces and clear blocked drains,” she adds.

Once ready (in about a week-15 days), your microgreens can be used in salads, juices, soups, as a garnish in your meals or even on sweet dishes, to add some extra flavour. “You can make out what plant’s microgreen you are eating as the flavour is so intense,” says Sangeeta."

Devlina Kumar and Gourab Chatterjee, who had earlier planned to get married on December 25, had to alter their wedding itinerary due to the pandemic and opt for a close-knit family affair instead. Sharing her palpable excitement with us, Devlina said, “Just our relatives and a few close friends would be present at the wedding. The registry is on December 15 and the reception will be hosted in March next year, so that my mashi, who stays in London, can be here with us.”

With the wedding less than a month away, has the bride-to-be decided on what she would be wearing on the big day? “Yes, for the wedding, I’ll wear a red Benarasi that I bought after Diwali. On the day of the registry, I want to go for an Indo-western outfit. Both Gourab and I are quite occupied with work. I am shooting for Arindam Sil’s Tirandhaj Shabar till December 7 and have a shoot lined up even on the day of our registry. So, let’s see how I can manage everything. My hectic schedule is keeping me from immersing myself in the pre-wedding excitement,” said the actress, who is back from Darjeeling where she was shooting for Abaar Kanchenjunga.

After marriage, Devlina will be moving into the Bhawanipore residence where Uttam Kumar, Gourab’s grandfather, used to live once. How does she feel about that? “I’ve been to Gourab’s house several times, so it’s not going to be new for me. However, the fact that I have to start living without my parents after marriage is yet to sink in. But of course, I’m looking forward to this new chapter of my life. Spending a few hours at his place and living there 24x7 are not the same,” she said with a smile.

Talking about how she first met Gourab, Devlina said, “It was through his sister Mou. She was getting married and Gourab was my dance partner at her sangeet. We gradually became friends and then started dating. Our first date was at a mall where we went for Mou’s wedding shopping.”

Speaking about her chemistry with Gourab, Devlina said she is the more romantic one. “Gourab is an introvert and I live in a dream world. I love all the romantic stuff like candlelit dinners and long drives in the rain. I fight with him a lot and then realise it’s me doing all the talking since Gourab is usually very quiet.” Meanwhile, the would-be groom, who is busy shooting for the serial Karunamoyee Rani Rashmoni, is looking forward to the wedding with equal excitement. “I am eagerly waiting for ‘the day’. What else can I say?” Gourab told us with a smile.
Despite their hectic schedules, the couple recently managed to go out and buy wedding rings for each other. They will be flying off to Puri for their honeymoon."

"  Nov 21, 2020, 01:11 IST",Ruman Ganguly,TV,Neel and Trina ready for a February wedding,"From being classmates to Bengali television’s heart-throbs – Trina Saha and Neel Bhattacharya’s association dates back more than a decade. And now, Gungun of Khorkuto and Nikhil of Krishnakoli are all set to tie the knot on February 4 next year. When asked about the reason behind this sudden decision at such an early stage of their career, the ecstatic lovebirds said in unison, “We can’t live without each other any further. So, we have decided to get married. Work will go on as usual.” In a candid chat with CT, the duo let us in on their relationship – the first meeting, the first date, the first kiss, the first proposal and more. Excerpts:

How did you two meet each other?

Neel: It all started in 2011 when we both decided to take CAT classes for MBA entrance exams. We didn’t know each other when we got enrolled. One day when I was attending a maths class, I suddenly saw a girl entering the class late. That was the first time I saw Trina. I still remember she was wearing a bright yellow dress. As they say, some moments change our lives. I think, for me, that was the moment. Based on that, I named her ‘Bright Sunny Day’ and after 10 years, I still call her by that name (smiles).
Trina: Honestly, I didn’t even notice him on the first day of our class. And when I did, I was not interested in him at all. Then after a few weeks, there was a class when my tuition friends were absent. I was getting highly bored and that’s when I saw Neel’s smiling face. He made a friendly gesture after which I asked him if I could sit beside him and his friends. I think that was the day we started to connect with each other. When was your first date?
Neel: It was on Friendship Day in 2011 at a disco-pub.
Trina: And our first kiss was on that day too! (laughs). Not many know that we have had our relationship in phases. The first phase was from August-October 2011 and then we parted ways. I shifted to Delhi for higher studies and Neel stayed back in Kolkata. For a long period of time, we were out of touch, busy with our individual lives. We reunited in 2015 when I came back from Delhi. Our friendship strengthened after that. Then in 2016, on June 8, which is Neel’s birthday, I realised my feelings for him. I walked straight up to him and said: ‘I love you. Tell me what do you feel about me?’
Did Neel feel the same way about you?
Trina: He was silent. For a few months, we had this unsaid relationship, but our bond started growing stronger. Finally, in 2017, on my birthday (January 21), Neel proposed to me in front of all our close friends and I took less than a second to say yes!
Where was your first trip together?
Neel: In Thailand. I was shooting there and Trina came all alone just to surprise me. It was the best birthday gift I could ever ask for. After the shoot, we stayed back and had a great time.
Do you remember your first fight?
Trina: We keep fighting, so it is impossible to remember that. But it is me who usually says sorry first, as I am short-tempered and fight without any rhyme or reason.
Neel: The longest we haven’t spoken to each other after a fight is 45 days!
What were your parents’ reactions when they came to know about your relationship?
Trina: Neel’s parents were very happy as they knew me for a really long time and both of them are very fond of me.
Neel: Trina’s mom told me, ‘Why did you keep lying to me about your relationship when we repeatedly kept asking you both?’
Who made the marriage proposal?

Trina: During one of our Sunday morning video calls, Neel asked me, ‘Can we get married in February 2021?’ After some discussion between our parents, we zeroed in on February 4, 2021 as our ‘the day’. We are getting married at a city club and the wedding reception is on February 14 in a garden. I am really excited to dress up as a traditional Bengali bou.

Have you two decided on your honeymoon destination yet?
N eel & Trina: Yes, Greece. It is our dream destination.

What do you like about Trina?

Neel: She is the most understanding person I have met till date. With her, I can have endless conversations on any topic under the sun.

What do you like about Neel?

Trina: Neel is the most honest and positive guy I have met till date. He is my support system. And touchwood, there are no insecurities between us as we are best of friends and will always remain so."

Since unlock began, she released a single, Edge, and has also nosedived into multiple film projects. She gets reflective as she talks about poetry, music, films and says that she would love to sing in Kannada once again. Excerpts...
FACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST

You've spent a major part of 2020 alone, giving you time to introspect. How are you looking at 2021?
I want to really just look ahead. I have always been kind of a loner. To leave me for these many months in my own mental juices has been amazing. I take this energy of introspection, joy and love for myself into 2021 with more music, movies and energy. It has been a tough time for everybody and I take those lessons forward.

How has 2020 worked out for the poet in you?
I've been writing poetry for years. It is that thing between me and my dad - a special dad-daughter thing. He's the one who encouraged me to write poetry. So, all of my lyrics somewhere are born out of my poetry. I like to speak poetically in life as well, because the things we are saying are so boring. Edge for me was that shift. I felt like I was in this beautiful black box in my head that blocked everything out and Edge was born out of that. Everything is so safe and calm, but with the pandemic I realised we're not. Edge was born from me being unafraid to go to that place - to go to the edge of pain, of happiness and of feeling any kind of energy. I think a lot of people resonated with the love part of it, because if you've loved right, you have gone there. What's next? Another single or an album?
I am like a singles person now, because of the attention span of human beings. But, in my heart, I am a concept album person. Side A and Side B, wit h B having all the good bits. I will hopefully do a concept album someday.

Did you get comfortable with the idea of collaborating, yet working alone and remotely?
I love working in the studio with people and bouncing off of energies and ideas. I miss that and a Zoom call is not a substitute. To just be with musicians in a room is my happy space. I am very old school like that.

After spending so many days in your black box, what was it like to be on a set?
I am all about energies and vibes. Even when people aren't saying anything, I get rainbows and sunshines if I feel it right. For all those months by myself, I had created this imaginary cave of amethyst and good vibes. The fear when I stepped out was to deflect bad juju and learn to take again and be receptive in a positive way. It was a lot for my auric senses when I first got back out. But it was amazing. It just jolted me back into life. The first day of shoot after lockdown, I was standing on a ledge, with fake rain and a giant wind fan and I am petrified of heights. I surely was back at work.

You're doing many projects now, after that self-imposed break. Was this conscious?
I love working. But, I am glad I took that break in between as I have come out more myself than I have ever intended to with my music and choice of roles. Now, even if I do a small role, I know people are resonating with it as I am resonating with my own frequency. 2020 was supposed to be that year of me going all guns blazing as far as work went. Now, everyone is saying 2021, but I am not waiting - I got back immediately.

Do you ever feel disarmed on a set shooting without a mask while others have theirs on?
There are people who believe that Covid-19 doesn't exist. There are others who believe it is like a cold. And there is the other side, where people have lost family members. It all happens so quickly. We've lost legends. It is a bit crazy to be in that environment. We are going to continue in this pandemic for a while. Hopefully this gives grace and humility to people about the fact that your ego doesn't control the universe. We are small and we have to be careful.


You sang in Kannada for the film Prithvi many years ago. Why haven't we seen you sing or act here since?

Nobody asked me to sing in Kannada again. If they do and I like the song, I will do it. I love singing in different languages. As far as acting in Kannada goes, I would love to work in Kannada. I didn't get offered what I wanted to do. I know about the industry as my father loves the Kannada film industry. He's spoken about it to me so much. But, it is not like checking a box of languages and industries. For me, it is checking the box of experiences and characters I get to play.


Your thoughts on Bengaluru...

There's a vibe about the city, which is a mix of mellow and progressive. I have always loved that. When I was younger, Bengaluru was this place which was really cool and we'd visit this city to party. I like the structure of the city. Now that the traffic is the same everywhere in India, it's not that special in Bengaluru anymore."

“I’ve been exploring comedy all this while. But I always wanted to do a thriller. This one is a murder mystery, which is inspired by Rajesh Kumar’s novel. I don’t want to reveal the name of the book now, as people might read it,” says Ezhil, and adds, “The film is based on a sound system... there is something called a war decibel, a sound people used to hear during the war. That sound is so high that people also call it the death decibel. The film touches upon that. Gautham plays a private detective, while Parthiban plays a cop. It will be a gripping thriller, with commercial elements.”


Newcomer Saipriya plays the female lead. He says, “We have begun shooting yesterday, in Chennai. We will shoot in Puducherry and Ooty, too. Shooting during the pandemic is difficult, but we are taking maximum precaution.” The film’s music is by D Imman."

"  Nov 22, 2020, 00:05 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Abhishek Banerjee: I am bracing myself for a busy 2021,"Abhishek Banerjee, last seen in a cameo in Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari with Manoj Bajpai and Karishma Tanna, has been keeping a busy schedule lately. The casting-director-turned-actor has been working on multiple projects as an actor and as a casting director. A few months ago, when the national lockdown had just begun to ease out, he was worried about how things would work in the new normal, pretty much like everyone else around him.


When asked if his opinion has changed, Abhishek says, “I used to feel a little weird and scared but things are going fine. It took us some time to understand how things will work. From the looks of it, the next year could be extremely busy for the industry. I am bracing myself for a busy 2021. In fact, with the way things are going, it will be very difficult for actors to juggle dates. Everyone has films and shows to be completed, and each one is in a different stage of production. January to April will be extremely hectic, but happy and happening because everyone wants to go back to work. The break was long and good, but now everyone wants to get back to work.”


The actor-casting director recently made his third trip to Goa, a place he has been nestling in for prolonged periods, ever since the nation went into unlock mode. “My wife is a half-Goan, so we have familial reasons to be here, too, apart from the obvious ones. Who knows I might even move bag and baggage here, but it won’t happen immediately,” says Abhishek who completed a schedule of Taapsee Pannu’s Rashmi Rocket before his brief holiday.

“We have started shooting and it’s turning out to be a great project. Akarsh Khurana and Taapsee are great friends of mine. After the first schedule, I will join the team in Mumbai for the next schedule. I am also doing Amar Kaushik’s forthcoming comedy. I’m yet to see the final script,” says Abhishek, adding, “I’m trying to keep myself disciplined as an artiste. I have to remain competent towards my job. As we move further, I will have lesser time to prep for a role. I have to learn to juggle my characters in my head. That’s the next leap for me. I always wanted to get here. I am no longer scared of being typecaste because I went past that zone, by carefully choosing what I say yes to. It’s also refreshing that filmmakers see me in so many different roles.”"

She also added, “It is because of this care and consideration that y’all have always shown I have a little favour to ask from all of you.

Year 2020 may not have done much for a lot of people but it did not stop Rahi’s track from coming to life.


The video, shot by Huzefa Roowala, capturing the life and essence of Jammu and Kashmir, has already found takers in filmmaker Imtiaz Ali, actors Tiger Shroff and Aditya Seal and actress Kriti Sanon to name a few. The iconic Dal lake, the luscious greenery and the frosty mountains have all found their way into the video that evokes the traveller in you and connects you with your higher inner-self.


Talking about Maahi, Rahi says, “I’ve always wanted to show a different side of Kashmir through my music, and this is just the beginning. Shooting the music video was a different experience. I’m happy with what we have achieved. I hope that Maahi will resonate with innumerable Kashmiris and music lovers all across the country.”

Rahi, who originally belongs to Kashmir, is currently based out of Mumbai.

The couple, who met on the set of 'Suhani Si Ek Ladki' where they played siblings, originally wanted to have a destination wedding, but the plan had to be altered because of the pandemic.

Krushna had said that he would not be able to perform comedy in front of his uncle, given the fact that their relationship has soured over the past few years. While Govinda had kept mum then, he has finally decided to break his silence. He says, “I am utterly sad to talk about this in public, but it is high time that the truth came out. I read the report about my nephew (Krushna Abhishek) not performing on a TV show as I was invited as a guest. He also spoke about our relationship. His statement had many defamatory comments and was thoughtless.”

Among other allegations, Krushna had said that his uncle had not met his twin sons — Rayaan and Krishaang — who were born in 2017. Refuting this, Govinda says, “I went to see the babies in the hospital, along with my family, and even met the doctor and the nurse taking care of them. However, the nurse told me that Kashmera Shah (Krushna’s wife) did not want any family member to meet them. When we insisted, we were allowed to see the boys from a distance, and we returned home with a heavy heart. However, I strongly feel that Krushna does not know about this incident. Later, he came to our home with the kids and Arti Singh (Krushna’s sister), which he has forgotten to mention.”


He further adds, “I’ve frequently been at the receiving end of Krushna and Kashmera’s defamatory comments — mostly in the media and some on their shows and stage performances. I don’t understand what they are gaining from all this. My relationship with Krushna was strong since the time he was a child; my family and people from the industry have witnessed it. I feel that washing dirty linen in public is an indication of insecurity and allows outsiders to take advantage of misunderstandings in a family.”

Govinda asserts, “Through this statement, I would like to announce that I shall maintain a graceful distance from now on and urge those who dislike me to do the same. Every family has misunderstandings and problems, but to discuss them in the media may cause irreparable damage. I am perhaps the most misunderstood person, but so be it. My late mother would always tell me, ‘Neki kar aur dariya mein daal’. That’s what I intend to do.”"

It was her last day of the shoot which went awry towards the last hours, when the film’s producer, Mahendra Dhariwal, allegedly misbehaved with her on the set of the film in Mumbai. Mandana told BT, “I am still in shock about what happened and how it happened. Koka Kola is a film that we have been working on for over a year now, and it’s been one of those jobs that you do despite knowing that the team is not being very professional. We all end up doing a few such jobs to just keep ourselves afloat. From the beginning, I had problems with this crew. The producer (Mahendra Dhariwal) is an old-school man who turns the set into a man-dominated, egoistic place. There are places where projects are driven by one person’s ego. That’s not new, but what happened on November 13 has shaken me up. It was the last day of my shoot and I wanted to wrap up and get going. I had another meeting lined up. On the last two days of the shoot, I had come in early and clocked in the hours, though the shoot wasn’t all about me. A little before wrap-up, the producer asked me for an hour more on the set, which I told him I can’t do as I have a meeting lined up. He said okay, and I went back on set to finish my last few takes. We were shooting for a song. But the moment I left the set and went to my vanity van to change, he forcefully came inside and started shouting, ‘You can’t leave. I asked you to do an extra hour and you have to listen because I am the producer and I have paid you.’ This set had no director or assistants. There was a choreographer, a stylist and the producer was calling the shots, literally. It’s the strangest job I have done in my nine years in India. He started creating a scene on the set along with his son and calling me names. It’s unsettling how they have behaved with me as an artiste and as a woman.”

Mandana adds, “He started saying, ‘Humne paise diye hain, lekin tumko kaam nahi karna hai, paise bhi poore chahiye, blackmail karti hai.’ After my last take, I went to my vanity van and told my spot boy to not let anyone in while I was changing my clothes. I thought the door was locked, but it wasn’t. In a few seconds, the producer came inside, since I was changing, I requested him to wait outside, but he refused and continued screaming. Luckily, the stylist (Hitendra Kapopara) ran into the vanity and pulled him out before things became uglier.”

The actress continues, “I am a single woman, I don’t have family here or a godfather, not even a manager or a PR person. I am trying to make a living on my own. I still can’t understand what really happened. A lot happens on a set, but this was absolute misbehaviour. People have called me and asked me who this shady guy is and why I am working with him. I have to support myself, there is no one else to help me with that. The last few months have been really tough. This behaviour amounts to mental harassment... being shouted at like that in front of so many people, being called names, being asked what visa am I working on, and telling me that I have no work and no one will work with me. In the last two months, the producer has messaged me several times, asking for dates. I was busy with two other projects. He and his son are not trustworthy people, and I wanted the full payment before I resumed work. I am here on an employment visa and I have paid my taxes. I have worked hard with dignity. I love India, and it’s been my home. People know me and have shown support, knowing how professional I am, but imagine being new and not having anyone to back you.”

Mandana says she was not allowed to use the production vehicle that was allocated to her. She adds, “First, the producer asked me to get out of his set. And when I got into the car, the producer’s son stopped the driver from driving me home. No one said anything about all of this. The only other person who helped me was the choreographer, who lent me his car to go home. I am not the first one to go through this, but I am someone who will not take it lying down. I will not go to that set ever again. I am done with it.”

I am okay with spending the money, but she has behaved unprofessionally with us: Mahendra Dhariwal
When Bombay Times reached out to producer Mahendra Dhariwal, he said, “We were shooting for Koka Kola with Sunny Leone and Mandana Karimi before the pandemic hit us. The shoot was halted due to the lockdown. We had signed Mandana for Rs 7 lakhs, but once the shooting began and got into continuity, she started acting up. Like when we were shooting in Delhi and she had to stay back for a day, she demanded Rs 2 lakh to be paid to her. Post-lockdown, when we started planning our shoot again, and we reached out to her for dates, she said she is busy. She demanded a sum of Rs 2 lakh a day for these new dates. She wanted the money to be paid in advance, which I did. On the last day, the shift was from 9 am to 9 pm. We had a set created and a song was being shot. At 7 pm, she said she has to leave. I requested her that we have to complete this today and I asked if she could wait for an hour more. She said okay and went back on set. At 8 pm, she got a call and she went into her vanity van. I ran after her to stop her from leaving because we still had a few shots left. I told her I would run into a loss as I will have to shoot the next day again. She wasn’t willing to stay back, and that is when I gave her an earful because she started packing up. Mandana started making videos of me screaming; I told her I am not scared. I entered the vanity van in about 10-15 seconds after she entered, and I knocked before entering. She asked me to step in. Public khadi thi bahar, and I was standing on the steps of the van. I requested for an additional 15 minutes, but I lost my cool when she started acting up. Later, she came back on the shooting floor and started making my videos. There were hundreds of people on the sets who can vouch for what I am saying. Prince, director-choreographer Ahmed Khan’s associate, who was choreographing, will tell you. In one-and-a-half years, for a contract of Rs 7 lakhs, she has taken Rs 17 lakhs, cash transactions included. I am okay with spending the money, but she has behaved unprofessionally with us.”"

"  Nov 23, 2020, 00:00 IST",P Sangeetha,Entertainment,Coimbatore artist pays Kamal Haasan a tribute through string art,"When Coimbatore-based artist Seevaga Vazhuthi decided to pay tribute to his matinee idol Ulaganayagan Kamal Haasan, he was sure of one thing. That, it has to be something very unique. Seevaga had already created a 3D illustration of a giant portrait of Kamal Haasan using 3,072 cups on the occasion of the 60th year anniversary celebrations of the actor in the film industry. So, this time around, he zeroed in on string art.
“It took 28 days, 250 hours of labour, 13,000 nails, 8km of string and a wooden board of 8ft in height to complete my art work,” begins Seevaga.

“I knew it would be a daunting task and would require a lot of patience and perseverance. But that didn’t deter me from carrying out the task. I did a thorough research on string art. I first bought samples of different types of nails and thread. I had to experiment with nails first as I had to ensure that I picked the ones that wouldn’t bend or damage the board. I then got on to the task of picking the strings. I used different shades for the skin, eyes, hair and shirt. I divided the work into mini segments and got on to it. And once I began, there was no looking back.”

Talking about the biggest challenge while making this artwork, Seevaga says, “ One big challenge was that the board had to be kept in a vertical position throughout the creation process. This meant hours of standing and working on it. It was back-breaking. I first did a rough sketch of the actor and then began hammering the nails with utmost precision. The string was wound around the grid of nails. Even a minor damage to the nail or wrong direction of the string could hamper the entire flow.”


But, it was all worth it when Seevaga’s idol appreciated him for his work. “The idea was to present this piece of art to Kamal Haasan sir on his birthday (November 7). Unfortunately, I couldn’t meet him that day. That said, when I met him recently, he instantly liked my creation. What more could an artist ask for? He listened to me in rapt attention as I explained the process. I had presented some of my works to him earlier and he remembered me. I was on cloud nine!”


Seevaga, who has been receiving many congratulatory calls, says he is glad that his work is being appreciated. “I am planning to do a tribute to Superstar Rajinikanth as well,” he adds."

The actor, who is currently dubbing for his portions for Seetharam Binoy, will be playing the role of a corporate CEO in his next, titled Savithri. Talking about the film and his role, Vijay says, ""I play a corporate CEO in the film, and Urvashi Rai plays my wife. The film is about family values. It shows how I, on my path to being a successful person, deal with my family. I begin shooting for the film from November 24 in a continuous 25-30 day schedule.""

Besides that, the actor is also thrilled about sharing screen space with Tara after almost 18 years. ""Tara madam plays the title role and it feels nice to share the screen with her after so many years. We worked together last in Ninagagi. This is only our second film together, so I'm looking forward to the film. She has a very pivotal role in the film,"" says the actor. As for now working non-stop after a long break, Vijay says, ""I'm happy about that. We've had a long break, so I don't mind working continuously. In fact, I'm hoping for a working Christmas as well."""
"  Nov 23, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Entertainment,"When you see what a mother goes through, you realise every child should have her name: Nakkhul","Nakkhul and his wife Sruti recently welcomed their baby girl Akira, in what they call a “surreal” water birthing process. Ever since then, the duo has been keeping it real about postpartum trauma, and the pressures on expectant parents and newlyweds, on social media. In a chat with us, Nakkhul and Sruti open up about being first-time parents in the time of coronavirus and normalising issues around pregnancy...
How is parenthood treating the two of you? Is there any anxiety attached to being new parents during the COVID-19 era?
Nakkhul: Many lives have been affected during these troubling times, but it has been a boon for me, because I got to experience parenthood from Day 1. You take up responsibility and your empathy goes up. It was a great experience seeing Sruti transition into a mother. We still can’t believe that we have a child together. It is such a surreal experience!

Sruti: We are well-rested and cannot be happier. Akira is our ray of sunshine during these dark times. Now, schools and the public spaces are becoming stricter; there is more awareness. So, we think we are getting her into a better world today.
Right from opting for a water birth to opening a dialogue on pregnancy trauma, you have been refreshingly vocal about first-time pregnancy on social media...
Nakkhul: This was one of the biggest moments of our lives, so we wanted it to be the way we wanted it to be. We wanted to set a good example for everyone. Early on during the pregnancy, I saw Sruti getting very nervous and anxious. We were meeting the doctors and everything, but something was off. At one point, she broke down and spoke about her fears. She began researching on the different kinds of birthing and new doors were opened.
Sruti: If you are old enough to get married and have a child, you are old enough to make your own decisions. The message we wanted to tell people was to stand up for themselves.

Sruti, you put up a post about the pressures of being a woman and facing uncomfortable questions as newlyweds...
Sruti: The day we got married, so many aunties came to us and wanted us to give them the “good news” immediately. My mother was the first to tell us to take things slow and not listen to them. And I was quite glad. Even a year after our marriage, people were telling, “It has been a year of enjoyment, now have a child.” I was like, I want to enjoy having a child also.

How did you opt for water birthing?

Sruti: Wherever we went, doctors would often call c-section the most common option. We are not against it. But when something natural is possible, why do you want to go under a knife? Being a first-time mother is very scary for most of us. But doctors would often tell me to just blindly go by faith. Women are shamed if they ask questions. Many women are slut-shamed by their own families, nurses and doctors. Everybody deserves respectful and gentle birthing. People should stop normalising trauma. My mother had a botched c-section. Women are being told that their bodies can’t birth babies or the baby is too big for their size. Who decides all this? People never talk about this because they think it is normal for women to go through this.

Nakkhul: What really pushed Sruti off the edge was when she was told I could not be in the operation theatre. This is when we discovered a birthing centre in Hyderabad. I finally saw colour coming to her face. People think that the method we chose is very outdated. But people need to know what midwives and doulas are. Some people think we went to a spa and gave birth. We went to a certified birthing centre that had an emergency OT. You do not have to do what we did. But all we are telling people is to do the research and ask the right questions.


How important was it for you to put this information out for new parents?
Sruti: We wish there was a way for midwives to be led on the same path as gynaecologists. Since I went through a water birth, we are not telling everyone to attempt the same. We want women to do what is best for them. Many doctors also lashed out at me for being so vocal about these things. But I am not telling them anything wrong. C-section is not wrong, but it should be done only when required. My labour was almost 14 hours long. My water broke at 6am and I gave birth post-midnight. It was a long and natural process.


Any reason behind the name Akira?
Nakkhul: Akira means graceful strength. I wanted to give some sort of homage to cinema. So, this was my nod to the great Akira Kurosowa. With Sruti being a big Dragon Ball Z fan, the name made sense because the creator of the show is Akira Toriyama (laughs). Our daughter’s full name is Akira Sruti Betarbet. When you see what a mother goes through during delivery, you realise that every child should have the mother’s name."

The actor was to have been engaged to Likitha, but her family backtracked based on the rumours that were floating around about members of the showbiz industry, unwilling to marry their daughter to an actor.
But it now appears that Pavan and his family have been able to convince Likitha's folks that not everyone's a bad apple in the industry, and has gotten engaged to her in a simple ceremony.




Pavan says, “When our engagement was called off, it was like a bolt out of the blue. My parents were shocked by the turn of evenrts, as Liktha's family made the call based solely on what they had been seeing and hearing about the industry. Thoughours was an arranged match, we had exchanged numbers and had been talking to each otther for a while and there was a special bond between us. Likitha, who is a doctor, was quite understanding, but her parents, who were looking out for her well-being, were reluctant to let the match go ahead. But since I was not at fault, I decided to convince them and they finally agreed.”


Pavan will get married on March 24 next year at a convention hall in Bengaluru next year. “As of now, we have not made plans about how to conduct the wedding. It will depend on the pandemic situation at the time,” he adds."
"  Nov 23, 2020, 00:01 IST",Tanvi Trivedi,TV,Bigg Boss 14: Jaan Kumar Sanu: My father divorced my mother and refused to be a part of our lives all these years,"‘Bigg Boss 14’ contestant Jaan Kumar Sanu is the latest contestant to be evicted from the house. The young singer’s journey did not last as long as he would have hoped for, but he made his presence felt on the show, thanks to the various controversies he was embroiled in during his stint. In a quick tête-à-tête, Jaan talks about his dislike for fellow contestant Nikki Tamboli, how Eijaz Khan and Pavitra Punia are strong contenders for the coveted trophy and how he felt it was silly to be called a ‘nepo-kid’ because his father, veteran singer Kumar Sanu, has never supported him. Excerpts:
People accused you of never taking a stand on the show and always following other individuals in the house. Comment.

That’s because I was timid, innocent and believed that I had to adjust and co-exist with everyone in the house. Just because I was nice and trying to be friends with everyone, people thought that I never took a stand or had an identity. If fighting with one another is how you get noticed in the show, then sorry, I can’t keep fighting with people to get noticed. Every contestant, who enters the house, feels that they will get brownie points only if they fight and add to the drama.
You had a big fight with Rahul Vaidya, who accused you of being a product of nepotism…

Rahul Vaidya is the smartest of the whole lot! But it was quite silly of him to start a fight with me on nepotism because everyone knows that I am not a product of nepotism. I guess he did not have any reason to nominate me, so without any concrete reason, he called me a ‘nepo-kid’. To be honest, I am hearing this term for the first time in my life. But Rahul is quite shrewd and knows how to play the game. He will last long on the show.

Talking about nepotism, your father Kumar Sanu and you haven’t kept in touch for 27 years. Would you like to tell us why?


We are three brothers and have been single-handedly brought up by my mother, Rita Bhattacharya. My father has never been a part of my life. I have no idea why he never supported or promoted me as a singer – you can ask him why. There are so many celebs in the industry, who have got divorced and remarried. They may not talk to their ex-wife, but they have never shied away from supporting their children from their first marriage. They have always taken responsibility for their children. But, in my case, my father Kumar Sanu refused to keep in touch with us. Initially, he had uploaded a video on social media regarding my upbringing and then there was another one supporting my work, so, I believe he has mixed feelings for me. I have not seen these videos. I don't think anyone has the right to raise questions on my upbringing because everyone has seen me in the show and appreciated my upbringing. And I feel I am am not answerable to anyone on this. Also, it is not right for a father to continue having resentment towards his children for such a long time. You might have differences with your partner, but most couples have seen to it that the children do not suffer. That’s why I find it quite silly when people say I am a product of nepotism. I have created my own path and will continue to do so in the future.


You had issues with Nikki Tamboli and Eijaz Khan, too?


Nikki Tamboli is a publicity hound and will do anything for attention. Her kissing me was also a publicity tactic to stay in the limelight on the show. She has no agenda, but to do anything for attention. Eijaz, on the other hand, is a good human being, but I feel on the show, he is too conscious of the fact that he has to keep the focus on him, otherwise he will lose brownie points. Otherwise, who wakes up at 5 am and starts checking other people’s belongings? So, in the show, he is quite a different guy, playing his game and getting too aggressive at times. Aly Goni has entered the show thinking he is a great guy and will resolve matters, but all his tactics are not going to work. I feel Pavitra Punia is playing her game really well and she will be among the top five along with Eijaz."

" Nov 24, 2020, 00:07 IST",Pallabi Dey Purkayastha,Entertainment,Aaryan Banthia’s fourth single ‘Paar’ hails the brave who are turning adversity into opportunity during the pandemic,"Popular musician Aaryan Banthia’s fourth new single 'Paar' released on November 21. The track speaks about the struggles of people from different strata of the society during the pandemic, how they have fought them bravely, and what the journey ahead holds. The singer with the magic touch has been steadily climbing the charts ever since he released his first single 'Yaadein'.
Aaryan is backed by his rock-solid talent alone and has three back-to-back hit songs to his credit. He also has the merit of being one of the few independent artists to have received widespread acclaim within a short time.


Speaking about his song, Aaryan Banthia, said, “Before I say anything about this song, I would like to quote my favorite lines from the lyrics of another song: There should be laughter after pain; there should be sunshine after rain; these things have always been the same; so, why worry now. This is the essence of my song ‘Paar’ which talks about how this too shall pass. The pandemic has been difficult on everyone. From the daily wage workers struggling to earn and the LGBTQ community trying to get an equal status, and those who have lost their jobs, there is something that everyone has been fighting for. They have all done their best, and are continuing to face the times with bravery. There is a long way to go but there is also light at the end of the tunnel.”

Aaryan’s debut Hindi track ‘Yaadein’ was a rock ballad with a subtle touch of blues and was released by a popular music company. He made his second appearance in a song called ‘Back in the Day’, an English track, which, despite belonging to the rock music genre, resonated with the young and elderly alike. Both his singles crossed the one-million mark on a video sharing platform in a short span of time. His third single called ‘Hey Betty’ depicted old school love and romance and crossed half a million views within just eight days of release.


Aaryan is an ardent guitar lover and all his solos including the recent 'Hey Betty' make extensive use of this instrument. Having grown up looking up to renowned guitarists like Mark Knopler, John Mayer, BB King and Paul Gilbert, Aaryan has immense passion for the instrument. In times to come post the pandemic, Aaryan plans to rewrite live shows and bring forth his musical style through various musical compositions and performances."

When it comes to fashion for men, florals are best suited for festive and wedding season, however, one can always sport the print in casual wear, too.


Jim Sarbh rocks a pantsuit in floral prints

“For those who don’t feel very confident with florals, can choose pastel floral prints to keep it subtle,” Ravi Gupta, owner and creative designer of menswear brand Gargee Designers, adding, “ It is a safe bet to use floral pieces while layering your outfits such as a blazer, Nehru Jacket or even drapes. If you wish to create a fusion, choose solid asymmetrical kurtas and club it with a floral Nehru jacket for a lasting impression. And for a cocktail evening, you may add a floral blazer to your regular solid shirt or even a short kurta. For those who want to go the traditional route, silk or crepe kurta in pastel floral print will be an attention grabber. You will surely be the centre of attention.” He advises that when choosing floral hues, one must always keep one’s skin tone in mind.

If you are from the groom's side, don't shy away from sporting floral prints


Designer Shruti Sharma says, “Banghgalas and kurtas are great for occasions like weddings and sangeet, however, those opting for solid colour kurtas, can experiment with safas, pocket squares and stoles in the print, to avoid going overboard.”


Accessorising it right



Take some cues from Terence Lewis and flaunt these happy prints with swag

Floral prints are quite bright and happy, hence choosing the right accessory that goes with it can be quite tricky. Ravi suggests, “While going the floral route, make sure that you keep the accessories subtle and minimal to let the flower power rule your style. Floral prints are a statement in themselves, so accessories should either complement the look or give it a stylish edge. For footwear, simplicity is the key, as nothing can beat the magic of modest tones with floral print. """

"  Nov 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,Separate mics and no physical contact in the new normal for live music gigs,"Before the pandemic, Bengaluru-based band Best Kept Secret was busy performing at some of the biggest events in the country. Then, as everything ground to a halt, they too remained at home, trying, like all other performing artistes, to remain relevant and adapt to the new normal. At that point, it meant learning to deliver a convincing performance from their homes. But as the country eased into unlock mode and events began again, it was time for them to take the stage, albeit while following strict safety measures.

The band recently had its first live show in months in Delhi – a private gathering for about 100 people. ""We performed at a wedding in Delhi last month; our first live performance in 7-8 months. While we were happy to be performing in front of a live audience, we were quite anxious as we didn't know what to expect or how the show would go,"" says Behram.


How different of an experience was it though? ""Taking selfies with people is little difficult now. We still take pictures, but from a distance. Besides, as a band, for now we have taken up only private events - we are not keen on doing public events where the crowd could be larger. Much as I love to see a huge crowd at our shows, right now, the thought scares me,"" he says, adding, ""Ever since the pandemic, all of us carry our own mics and I spend close to 10 minutes just sanitising the mic stand. We function as a unit, so we cannot risk the slightest chance of falling ill, because if one of us does, then we cannot perform as a band. In addition to this, we also have some ground rules that we convey to the event organisers. We tell people that the band won't come in physical contact with anyone. There will be no hugging, kissing or crowd surfing. The equipment needs to be sanitised before and after we arrive on the stage to perform. In fact, now a lot of thought goes into our transportation and accommodation too."""
"  Nov 24, 2020, 00:00 IST",,TV,Sudeep returns as the judge of Bigg Boss Kannada; Season 8 to air post Sankranthi,"Fans of Bigg Boss Kannada who missed the annual airing of the show around this time of the year, have reason to cheer. The reality show will go on air in the third week of January, post Sankranthi, and will return in a ‘celebrities only’ format. “We have decided to go ahead with the show post Sankranthi/Pongal and will feature only celebrities; there will be 15 of them. We have already begun touching base with possible contestants,” shares Parmeshwar Gundkal, business head of the channel behind the show. So is the decision to make it a celebrity-oriented one based on the fact that audiences need highly engaging content, given that these are challenging times? “We have had good ratings when the show was celebrity driven and equally encouraging when the programme also had common folk. And unlike popular perception, it is not episodes that have fights that fetch TRPs, but the emotionally-loaded ones that have grabbed eyeballs. Also, controversy is not the motive of the show. Perception and reality are very different,” he points out. Bigg Boss has a specific formula in place when it comes to its contestants: yesteryear actors, television actors, social media sensations, glamorous starlets amongst others. Will a similar template be followed this time, too? “Yes, it is largely that. But we never plan it in that manner. Some of our most dramatic entries have happened at the nth hour. Be it Pratham, Niveditha Gowda, Vasuki Vaibhav or Shine Shetty - they came on board a day or two before the launch and some even a few hours prior to the event. The idea is to give audiences an insight into various kinds of human relationships and the curiosity factor is higher when it comes to celebrities,” concurs Parmeshwar.

So what will be different this season? “The concept of quarantining contestants before we launch the show, getting them tested and ensuring their safety is the biggest change. We are also yet to decide on having audiences in the studio for the weekend episodes, but that’s a minor concern,” he avers. Season 8 will once again be hosted by Sudeep, and Param says he is bowled over by the commitment of the actor towards the show. “The minute I told him we want to go ahead with the show, Sudeep said ‘yes’ without batting an eyelid. He doesn’t have schedules abroad as of now and will mostly be shooting in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. So Sudeep will be able to give us the weekends. We will be meeting soon to discuss further plans,” sums up Parmeshwar.

Sumalatha adds, “I am humbled and grateful to Ambareesh’s fans that even though it has been two years since he has left us, they still revere him.

But due to the pandemic, many sabhas and organisers have decided to conduct the Margazhi festival virtually. With the Tamil Nadu government giving permission to conduct the festivals in halls with a maximum 200 people in attendance at a time adhering to the coronavirus protocol, organisers, artistes and rasikas discuss the feasibility of conducting the programmes live.
Safety is a challenge
The Federation of City Sabhas (FCS), which includes Brahma Gana Sabha, Hamsadhwani, Karthik Fine Arts, Narada Gana Sabha, Rasika Ranjani Sabha, Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha and Sri Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha, has decided to stream their programmes on a specially dedicated online page. K Harishankar, secretary, FCS says, “It is a good decision by the government. But the average age of those who attend concerts is above 55. The pandemic is not over and it will be difficult to host live performances now. We’ve already begun shooting our concerts and will go ahead with our plan of streaming it online. Maybe, those artistes and dance arangetrams, who missed out on live performances can conduct it now, with limited audience.”


Eminent Carnatic musician Sudha Ragunathan says that it’s a good decision, but a half-welcome one, as the risk is still high. “Even if there are temperature checks, sanitising, and social distancing, there are people who are asymptomatic. Among the artistes, there are musicians of different age groups. Some of them made a wise decision of performing virtual. So, it would be wise to wait before taking performances on ground.”
Mudhra Bhaskar, founder-secretary of Mudhra, says that the government’s decision has come late. “We start preparing for December concerts in advance. I have decided to stream them through our platform. To organise a live concert now will be difficult, and we don’t know whether the audience will be able to sit through the concert wearing mask. However, as the permission has come,we will conduct the inaugural event at a venue. But this one, too, will only be for select invitees,” he says.

A welcome change

Carnatic musician Palghat R Ramprasad recently performed live for an audience of 40 people. “During the lockdown, it was just facing the camera and performing. To get back on stage, see human beings, and interact with them was quite reassuring and it was also heartening to see all of them follow the protocols,” he says, and adds, “We are not getting back to normalcy any time soon. If organisers and rasikas are able to follow a certain level of discipline like wearing masks and sanitisation, there is no harm in performing live.”


Subhasree Thanikachalam of Margazhi Maha Utsavam used to conduct the events in an open-air auditorium with around 800-odd rasikas. Though she welcomes the government’s decision, she wonders whether the rasikas would be able to come. She says, “I’d love to have it live, with limited seating. But would children send their parents? Youngsters should give assurance to senior citizens that it is safe, provided they wear masks and are careful so that they can go for live performances. Avoiding live performances will not help the artform.”


G Padmanabhan, a 66-year-old rasika, is a member of three sabhas. He says, “I’d love to go to the venue, wearing a mask to watch the performance live. But for the sabhas to be able to sanitise at all times will be a task, as they are dependent on volunteers. Senior citizens will hold the doors, touch the chairs and find it difficult to wear a mask for two hours in an AC auditorium. But for upcoming artistes, this will be a boon as they can get live audiences for their music to be heard,” he says."

Her ravishing glamour, on the other hand, has a fan base of its own! The journey she has had from early modeling days has been exceptionally evident, and she is for sure paving her own path in the B town.

Throughout the lockdown, the actress has entertained all her followers with exciting posts, and recently, the star posted new pictures from the land of apples, Kashmir! The model flew to the northern state for an upcoming undisclosed project, which has already built our anticipation at the peak.


Unbothered by the chilly winters, our very own Indian Elsa can be seen playing in the snow in nothing but a white sports bra and a mulberry gym pants paired with a flimsy blue and red scarf, showing off her perfectly toned and worked out body.


Enjoying the scenic beauty of the winter wonderland to the max, Pranati was also seen posing in the snow, wearing a traditional embroidered kurta in white, camouflaging in the snowy backgrounds. The artistic detailing of greens on the kurta adds a touch of elegance to the whole look, and we can’t deny that the smile on her face tells us all about her trip.


On the career note, Pranati Rai Prakash started her journey from Miss India 2015, where she emerged as a semi-finalist, later going on to win India’s Next Top Model 2016 edition.Pranati has come a long way since then, featuring in several TV commercials and was recently a part of Imtiaz Ali’s blockbuster, 'Love Aaj Kal'. She will be soon announcing her back to back Album and also an exciting project with a big banner till then wait for the announcement."
"  Nov 24, 2020, 00:22 IST",Pallabi Dey Purkayastha,,"‘Come Play’ movie features a three-dimensional horror character ‘Larry’, brought to life by the art of puppetry","Larry is terrifying. He has very scratchy nails, too, and it’s not nice when he holds your hand. Director Jacob Chase wanted Larry to be a physical presence in the feature, which is not a usual industry practice. In a lot of movies like this, the Larry creature would be done with all visual effects, and that has become the standard. However, the producers recognised that CGI wouldn’t do in this instance; a three-dimensional Larry was necessary to impart the immediacy and physicality Chase was seeking for the feature. Moreover, a practical effect would be a boon for the cast and having that physical being to act off is valuable, especially when working with kids.
Chase’s experience making haunted houses was evident in Larry’s appearance, “I made Larry as a half puppet, half costume thing because I was used to making practical props, puppets and monsters,” he recalls. “It ended up working really well because it felt like Larry was there in the environment with the main character in the shot.”


The puppet’s arrivals on set were met with excited and expectant folks, who wanted to see him being assembled and in action. It was like having another actor to act against in a scene rather than a tennis ball on a c-stand. The puppet required a team of three, and sometimes four, to operate and direct its movements, and presented a technical challenge to reduce the impact of their shadows and manage the dark tones.
The Jim Henson Creature Shop was chosen to create and build Larry as a tactile creature.


Chase explains, “They’re known for the best puppetry in the world and can create emotion and really bring a character to life through puppetry.”


The filmmakers hope that Larry’s adventure in search of a friend will bring both screams and tears from audiences this November 27 on the big screen.


This powerful story about love and friendship stars newcomer Azhy Robertson (Marriage Story, Juliet, Naked), Gillian Jacobs (“Love,” “Community”), and John Gallagher Jr. (10 Cloverfield Lane, Hush), and co-stars Jayden Marine, Winslow Fegley, and Gavin MacIver Wright.

An ace director, producer and actor, SAC, as he is popularly known as, applied for the registration in the first week of November. This created a furore over the internet speculating Master actor’s political entry and immediately Vijay released a statement distancing himself from the party. He also asked his fans to stay away from the party and warned his dad with serious consequences if his photo or name has been used for the party’s popularity. However, SAC said that Vijay is caught in a vicious circle and he applied for registration with ECI considering his son’s welfare and also to recognise those fans who have been toiling for him without expecting anything in return.


SAC’s move actually brought out the issues in his family out in the open with his wife Sobha saying that he got her signature without telling her that it was for registering it as a political party. She had also revealed that Vijay and SAC have not been talking to each other for some time.


In the meantime, it’s reported that SAC has written to the ECI asking them not to register the party. He has not given any statement for his sudden withdrawal of the application. But it is speculated that strong opposition from within family, including his wife, had forced the veteran to step back from his effort.

Though Vijay has not shown interest in active politics so far, of late, the actor’s films and speech at his film’s functions have been laden with lines that give a hint towards his political interests."

Kumar Sanu is hurt by his son Jaan Kumar Sanu’s recent comments that his father has never been a part of this life. Jaan, who was recently evicted from the Bigg Boss house, also said that he has been single-handedly brought up by his mother, Rita Bhattacharya.

Speaking to Bombay Times from Los Angeles, Kumar Sanu said, “It is sad that Jaan is saying all this about me when he met me right before he went into the Bigg Boss house. He says I haven’t given them anything, but the fact is that during the divorce, I gave Ritaji what she had asked for, including my very first bungalow.”


The veteran singer shared, “The court had given custody of our three children to her because they were quite young. She has raised them single-handedly, which is commendable. I used to meet them under restrictions for a limited time. Later, after I remarried, I moved out of India because I did not have much work in Mumbai. But whenever I visited India, I would get in touch with my sons Jessy, Jeeko, and Jaan. We went out for dinner a few times. They were busy with their lives, but whenever they contacted me, I would try to be available if I was in Mumbai. We were in touch over calls. My work is such that I can never be in one place for a long duration. I can’t even stay with my wife Saloni and my two daughters for a long span of time, as I have to travel all over the world for concerts.”
One of the allegations that Jaan made was that his father never helped him in his career. Jaan told BT, “I have no idea why he never supported or promoted me as a singer… you can ask him why. I find it quite silly when people say I am a product of nepotism. I have created my own path.”

Jaan Kumar Sanu

Reacting to this, Kumar Sanu said, “Jaan would send me songs and ask me what I thought about his singing. I have always encouraged him, and I always will. He asked me to call a few industry people who I know. I called Mukesh Bhattji, Ramesh Tauraniji and a few others, and Jaan went to meet them, but now it’s up to them if they want to give him work. In fact, when Jaan wanted to be a part of some of my live concerts, I let him join me for a few.”

Talking about his son’s comment on his mother bringing him up single-handedly, Kumar Sanu said, “I’ve heard him say in his interviews and also in the Bigg Boss house that his mother is his mom and dad for him. I appreciate his respect for his mom, and I believe in giving even more respect to his mother. He should write his name as Jaan Rita Bhattacharya, not Jaan Kumar Sanu because, firstly, Ritaji has done a lot for him, and secondly, people will start comparing him with me, which is not good for him as a newcomer. I’d be the happiest father to see him successful.”


He added, “Recently, when I tested positive for COVID-19, I was all alone. I was so weak and sick that I couldn’t go to the washroom by myself, but none of my sons bothered to ask about my health. Love can’t be just one-sided. It’s always two ways.”

About the role, Abhishek shares, “I am quite thrilled that I am making my debut as a hero after all the controversies. I play the role of college student, Krishna Murthy. I will be having two breakups on Valentine’s Day, which is why the title is 14 Feb. The movie touches upon teenage relationships and reasons for breakups with a subtle message for both parents and youngsters. There are four female leads in the movie, all played by newcomers.


Talking about his recent ordeal in the Sandalwood drug scandal, Abhishek says, “I was called for inquiry because I had shared a photo of myself with Kishore Shetty, who has a connection with the drug scandal, on my social media pages. I had met him during the Dance Karnataka Dance television reality show and that was the last time I met him in 2014. The worst things started to come after the inquiry. I was in a discussion about a film project but the producer decided not to cast me as there was so much negative publicity around me.""


Though Abhishek lost a project, the Gattimela serial team welcomed him wholeheartedly, which gave the confidence to start working towards his dreams again. “I started my career as a dancer, then forayed to the small screen acting in serials. The competition is stiff in the industry and for a newcomer with no filmi background it is tough to get offers.

It didn’t make business sense for them to incur operation costs when the likelihood of having audiences come to the theatres remained slim.
Last weekend, though, that changed, when filmmaker Mansore chose to have his latest become the first new Kannada movie to release in the new normal. And the response to it, it would seem, has put to rest the doubts that production houses, distributors and exhibitors had about audiences returning to cinema halls.

Over the weekend, the film had houseful boards at several theatres, which stakeholders see as a positive sign. So much so that distributors now say that they are looking at a staggered release plan for new films in cinema halls.
Karthik Gowda, who released the first new Kannada film in the post pandemic era, says, ""It is heartening that people are still keen on the whole theatre experience. We saw houseful boards, which is a good sign for the industry. The idea now is to ensure there is no crowding like the way we used to have earlier for new releases and give room for the new releases to attract crowds. Good content is always the key for this.""


Distributor Manjunath Gowda, who is releasing two new films this week, says, ""Right now, only a few distributors are ready to release new films. We have an understanding with each other to not step on each other’s toes when scheduling releases. In fact, I am looking at a fortnight’s break between each of my new releases, so that the other distributors can schedule their films in the interim.”


But with only a few single screens functional, won't this impact the business? ""The films that are releasing now are not big star films, so the number of multiplex and single screens available now will work for them. If these films continue to do well, more screens will open up,"" says Karthik.


Manjunath agrees and adds, ""We have a limited number of screens functioning now. The idea is not to uproot any of the films that have released now. We will only look at the cinema halls that reopen now for the new releases so that everyone has room to breathe.”"

But it looks like even that couldn’t salvage the situation,” observes Aravind.

In fact, his team has been getting messages on their social media handle about the incompetence of some members of the cast, the make-up and lack of acting skills, among others. “This was a clear smear campaign as they were concerted efforts in maligning our show. We had been receiving encouraging feedback from our regular viewers. Maybe a certain section of the audience didn’t like what we were showing, so that must have done our serial in. Channels too have a business to run, so unless the TRPs come in, they too can’t keep a show up and running,” concurs Aravind, adding, ""My previous venture Kamali was a runaway success, Arasi was the serial that introduced Rachita Ram, Srinivasa Kalyana did well, as did Antahpura and Saaguta Doora Doora. I will continue putting in my best with every project and such things don’t deter me,” Aravind concludes.

While people are getting ready to bring in the festival in a fun way, Vidyut Jammwal, too, has a plan up his sleeve. The actor shared a creative, in which he’s dressed up as Santa Claus.

Like Chennaiites are with this unwanted guest, Nivar, lurking around. Riding at wind’s speed and expected to make a landfall close to Chennai, many wonder if this cyclone will be as furious and wrathful as Vardah was, or will it lose its steam and release its pent-up energy elsewhere? Though an element of unpredictability accompanies all weather-related forecasts and assessments, namma weather-watchers from Tamil Nadu help us decode this tempest...
'The wind speed will be somewhat close to that of Vardah’

The cyclone is expected to make the landfall between midnight and early morning tomorrow. What we saw on Tuesday was only intermittent rain. But today, it’s going to be very heavy rain without a break across the coastal area. Generally, the wind is stronger on the northern side of the cyclone. So, even if it crosses at Mahabalipuram, Chennai will feel the cyclonic effect. The wind speed will be 110km/hour, somewhat close to the speed that Vardah had. But the recent trend is that we are seeing 10 to 20 per cent increase in speed than what is initially expected. Following the cyclone, there will be rain tomorrow as well. We’ll have rain in the coming days, too, as this is our monsoon time and there are good easterlies.


— Pradeep John, a weather blogger aka Tamil Nadu Weatherman
‘Nivar will interact with the land much before the actual landfall’

As the Nivar Cyclone comes closer to the coast, rain spell will increase, especially when it nears Puducherry. This situation will continue till Thursday. The cyclone is making slow progress — it should have crossed the coast around this afternoon or early evening, but it looks like it will be late night by the time it happens. Some people have asked if the intensity of Nivar could be more than Vardah’s. I’d say, it all depends on the angle. Vardah was a direct west to east cyclone and Chennai was the first place it made landfall. But Nivar is coming from southeast and there will be some land interaction even before the landfall. It will come along the coast and then, cross the land. That angle makes all the difference between this one and cyclones like Vardah and Gaja.

— Srikanth, independent weather blogger (ChennaiRains)

‘People in the Delta region are in panic mode and some are even cutting down trees out of fear’

Today morning, the cyclone will intensify into a severe cyclone. And the landfall is expected to be in the Cuddalore-Pondicherry area. If the landfall is near Cuddalore-Pichavaram area, Mayiladuthurai, which is in north Delta region, will get good rains and have moderate winds. It is the north Tamil Nadu that has to be prepared for a very severe cyclone. But after the Cyclone Gaja in 2018, people in the Delta region seem to be in panic mode even if there is very little possibility of the Delta region getting affected. Unfortunately, some fake news, too, spread about cyclonic effects in the Delta region. So, I have been getting a lot of panic calls. Some people in the Delta region are also cutting down trees out of fear.


— R Hemachandar, who blogs as Delta Weather Man


Will trees withstand the fury of the cyclone better than the last time?


Our organisation, Nizhal, has been planting native trees, which are location-specific ones. They can withstand water-logging, strong wind, etc. But even native trees, which have been abused by building concrete structures around them, nailing their trunks and putting lights around them, are vulnerable in extreme weather conditions due the stress they have been going through. We lack enforcement to stop all this. Also, pruning has to be done periodically in the right way to remove branches that destabilise a tree. We need to focus on the health management of trees and sensitive greening in urban areas.

"  Nov 25, 2020, 00:00 IST",,TV,Bigg Boss 14: Aly Goni loses his cool during his verbal fight with Kavita Kaushik; says 'Yahan lambe monologue deke audition dene aayi hai phir bhi koi kaam nahi dega',"Bigg Boss 14's latest episode was full on high voltage drama. Bigg Boss asked all the housemates to gather in the living room and announced how few housemates have been breaking the rules of the house. He gave the new captain Kavita Kaushik and she is instructed to give the personal belongings of the housemates who break the rules to Bigg Boss. She has to drop them in a giant box that Bigg Boss has arranged.
Nikki informs Kavita that Aly had shared a chocolate with Pavitra which was part of the luxury budget task. Kavita immediately drops Aly’s grooming items in the box. Aly gets irritated as he feels that Kavita should have asked him before dropping his personal belongings. He goes and removes his and trimmer back. Kavita gets upset with Aly for breaking the rules of the task. Soon, they get into war of words and Aly calls her names like 'ghatiyaa' and 'neech aurat'.

During the fight Aly tells Kavita yahan itne lambe lambe monolouge deke, audition dene aayi ho... phir bhi koi kaam nahi dega (you are giving monologues in the show to get work but no one will give you work). Kavita responds to this at least I have done better work than you and have not played 'cheel'. Aly Goni quickly takes Ekta Kappor's name and says that Kavita is disrespecting her. Kavita asks him to fight on his own and not drag others.

Their fight goes out of hand as Aly Goni violent and kicks the big box which Kavita was leaning on to. She gets hurt on her hand. Kavita complains to Bigg Boss that she does not feel safe seeing Aly’s aggressive behaviour. A teary-eyed Kavita is seen asking Bigg Boss to get her out of the Bigg Boss house and even says that either of them will stay in the house.


Abhinav, Jasmin support Aly Goni and did not let the task happen.


Bigg Boss punished Aly for destroying the property of the house and he is nominated for next week also. Abhinav was ordered to keep all his personal belongings in the store room.

"  Nov 25, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,Lifestyle,"With nowhere to go amid the pandemic, young Delhiites wear their fave boots at home, flaunt them online","""I spent the last winter waiting for the end of the season sale to buy an expensive pair of leather, knee-length boots. Had to carefully put them away for summer season, hoping I would get to flaunt them in winters. But winters are here and I wonder if I should just put these boots away for another year as I have nowhere to go,” says Priya Rana, a young marketing professional, who is now wearing those boots at home to post pictures on her social media. “There are just few things you can do to cheer yourself up while working from home. So I chose to dress up in a knit dress and wear the boots I have waited to wear since last year. I’ll at least get a chance to flaunt them on social media,” she adds.

There are many who wait for Delhi winters just to flaunt their jackets and boots. But with nowhere to go this winter season, many are left disappointed and wondering on how to make use of expensive boots which they could only wear for a couple of months in a year. “Sadly, this is the only time in a year when you can wear boots. I bought an ankle length boot last year, especially to wear at parties. Least did I know that this year there would be no parties to go to! Also, though I carefully managed to store my boots for a year, I am afraid if I would be able to carefully store them for one more year. So just for my satisfaction I wear them often at home now,” says third-year graduation student Ritika Nayak – Delhi Times Fresh Face Season 12 winner – who also did a shoot at her home in her new boots.



Like Ritika, Radhika Bansal, a third-year student of Delhi University, too, did a shoot at home just to wear her new boots. “I had especially saved money to buy these boots last year. I saw very expensive knee-length boots online. I looked up different websites to find something which I could buy and would be similar to those boots. After searching online for weeks, I managed to find something similar. In my mind, I had a dress and a bag that would go along with those boots. Since I am not going to college now, I decided to do my shoot in my new boots and that dress at home.”

Sakshi Singh, a first-year college student, had saved money from her pocket money last year (when she was in school) to buy boots for her college. “These boots are my most expensive buy so far. I got them at around Rs 4,000 at a 50% discount just because I wanted something very stylish for college. Sadly, I am still waiting for the day to wear them in college. I still wore them on my first day of college, when I was a part of an online orientation programme from home,” she says."
"  Nov 25, 2020, 01:00 IST",Neha Maheshwri,,‘Knock-knock’ gang steals Manasvi Vashist’s mobile phone; the actor files an FIR,"A routine visit to a salon turned into an unpleasant experience for Manasvi Vashist after a gang of thieves targeted him at SV Road in Malad and fled with his mobile phone. The ‘Ishq Mein Marjawan 2’ actor narrates, “I was at a traffic signal when a young man gestured that something was wrong with my car and I should get off immediately. I found him fishy and ignored him. However, a few minutes later, when another guy knocked on the window and told me that sparks are flying off the bonnet, I got frightened.”

“He suggested that I pull over and even called a mechanic, who said that there was a short circuit. After that, he buried his head deep inside the bonnet and did something, which I couldn’t see. He later told me that the issue was addressed in the nick of time or else, I wouldn’t have been alive. All I could do was thank both of them for their timely help. After ‘fixing’ the engine, he asked me to check the car and left within seconds. It’s only some time later I realised that my phone was missing,” says Manasvi, adding, “I spent almost two hours inquiring about that mechanic. While I was asking around about him, one of the mechanics in the area told me about the ‘knock-knock’ gang and their modus operandi — how one person knocks on the window of your car and steals your belongings by diverting your attention. I fell prey to them because I am new in the city.”


Manasvi decided to file a complaint against the gang. He shares, “The police told me that a similar incident had taken place previously as well. Apparently, the gang sells phone parts to avoid being tracked. I hope they are nabbed soon, so that no innocent person is conned again.”"
"  Nov 26, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sunayana Suresh,Entertainment,Suchitra Krishnamoorthi is debuting a new version of her stage production in Bengaluru,"Actor, writer and musician Suchitra Krishnamoorthi is headed to Bengaluru this weekend, to premiere a new version of her stage production The Queen Of Drama. This is going to be the first big show at Chowdiah Memorial Hall in months. ""I have written, composed the music, written the lyrics and am now producing it too,"" Suchitra says, about the production. ""The show happens to be on my birthday and I thought it would be a good way to start the new year,"" she adds.
On choosing to work during the pandemic, Suchitra points out that ""One can either wait it out forever or do what needs to be done."" That said, the hall will operate at just 20 per cent its capacity, for the show. ""Chowdiah is taking extra care to sanitize the place. It is time to start living again, but with caution. As an artiste what else can one do? We have to live and perform,"" she says, adding about The Queen Of Drama, ""It is a fun and light watch. Given that it has been such a hard time for everyone, I just want people to come and have a good laugh and go back home.""

In the initial years of her career, Suchitra has worked across different film industries. ""At that time, the offers came easily and I just did them without much thought. I was quite whimsical, so I didn't use the opportunities I got well enough. Now, I feel is my second innings and I am all charged,"" she shares, adding that she yearns for good roles now.

She also adds that actors have it better today. ""Earlier, there were only certain kind of stories being made and only people with a certain look or personality got a break. Now, it has opened up a lot more with newer spaces like the web and unconventional stories coming out. It is a lot nicer and more equal. When I was busy, I was on top of the inequality ladder. In our time, the big task was getting a break. Now, everyone gets that break, but the task is to sustain,"" Suchitra points out.


Speaking her mind...

Talking about her social media presence and never holding back from commenting on issues, Suchitra says, ""I suffer from what you call spontaneous combustion. I feel very involved in the world around me. If I think there is something wrong, I always tend to stand up for what I believe is right. Sometimes it works and sometimes it backfires. But I just stick to my conscience."" But doesn't she worry about being trolled? ""I am used to being trolled. It no longer affects me. I feel everybody has a right to their opinion. So even the trolls are entitled to theirs. I am totally fine with being trolled,"" she explains.


Coming up next: A new single

Suchitra is also gearing up to release a new single. ""In the lockdown, I wrote two beautiful songs. I have recorded the scratch for one of them and should be shooting the video in January and putting it out,"" she says."

"  Nov 26, 2020, 01:09 IST",Onkar Kulkarni,Entertainment,EXCLUSIVE! Taapsee Pannu: I don’t have a reason to uproot myself from the South film industry,"Taapsee Pannu is one of the few actresses who has successfully and skillfully balanced her work in Bollywood along with notable projects in Tamil and Telugu film industries. She made her debut in 2010 with the Telugu film 'Jhummandi Nadam', and went on to be a part of over a dozen South films including 'Aadukalam' (2011) and 'Mr Perfect' (2011), before she stepped into Bollywood with 'Chashme Baddoor' (2013).

Over the years, while she cemented her position in Bollywood with films like 'Baby' (2015), 'Pink' (2016), 'Judwaa 2' (2017), 'Badla' (2019) and 'Thappad' (2020), among others, she continued to be a part of South films. Talking about the balancing act, Taapsee says, “A lot of people had told me that I would have to compromise on one (industry) for the other. I did not understand the logic behind it. The one thing I understood was that when I started off in Hindi films, I wanted to give it more attention, as I had to get used to this industry and be more visible here. But once you have done a fair amount of work in both the industries, then everybody knows what you are capable of. I didn’t worry about making my presence felt more in one industry than the other.”


The actress, who recently shot for her Tamil film with actor Vijay Sethupathi in Jaipur, says that she ensures that she does at least one South film every year. She explains, “I don’t have a reason to uproot myself from there. People there are really good to work with. The audience there has liked my films for so many years and continue to do so even after I started working in Hindi films.”

Taapsee feels that doing films in multiple industries has helped her become a better actress. She elaborates, “Acting is a skill, the more you use it, the better it becomes. Working in different industries, environments and cultures has helped me grow as an actor and a human being. Every time I start a new film, I have to brush up my Tamil or Telugu language skills, which is a learning experience. I consider myself lucky, else who gets the privilege of working in different languages and being accepted in more than one industry? I think it is a luxury.”"

This is the fifth time the duo will be working together. Naganna, who had previously directed Upendra in Kutumba, Gowramma, Gokarna and Dubai Babu, says, “There is a wave length between us which makes it easy to understand each other's work very well. Our new project, which is based on a historical subject, will be made on a larg scale. The script work has begun and we are looking to rope in a popular South Indian actress for as the female lead. The shoot is being planned in Rajasthan, North Karnataka and Kerala. We will reveal more details in next year.”

Upendra reveals that the film will be made in multiple languages. “It will be made in four different languages. The subject is such that it deserves to be made in other languages.

"  Nov 27, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,TV,Puvi: Audiences take television seriously and change for good,"From starting his career as a dance show winner to playing supporting roles, and then eventually essaying the lead role — television actor Puviarasu Muthusamy aka Puvi has come a long way. With his current television serial, Oru Oorla Oru Rajakumari (OOOR) crossing 700 episodes, Puvi is a happy man.
“I was roped in as a replacement to the actor who was previously playing the lead role and I was worried if audiences would accept me. Also, I was popular as Jeeva from Azhagiya Tamil Magal. I didn’t want audiences to see me as Jeeva in OOOR. Gradually, audiences, too, accepted my character. My mother is my audience and she tells me that I am killing it as Iniyan (laughs). I am so happy to be part of a project that plays out real-life scenarios,” says Puvi.

The serial follows the life of Rasathi (Ashwini), a young, overweight girl who battles body shaming, with Iniyan (Puvi) playing the role of her husband. With the serial breaking stereotypes, Puvi says that people, too, shouldn’t be concerned about all that. “Ashwini and I went for an event, and we met a lady, who said her husband now looks after her with so much love and affection. She said being overweight affected her, and things changed when they saw the serial together. Somewhere, I believe audiences take television serials seriously, and change for good. Honestly, I didn’t think things like these affect someone so deeply,” he says.
Puvi adds, “My co-star Ashwini herself had gone through so many challenges. But she faced it all with courage. My mother, too, was lean when she got married, but she had put on weight after a certain age. One shouldn’t shame someone for being obese and that’s what we try to say in the serial, too.”

Puvi plays a kabaddi coach in the serial and was very happy to get trained in the sport. He says, “I am a national-level hockey player. So, I am naturally excited to play some kind of sports. While I was training for kabaddi, I felt like I was able to see my old self — the energetic sportsman,” he smiles.


While he enjoys all the love he’s receiving now, Puvi says that he didn’t really plan on becoming an actor. He says, “I am a dancer and tried my luck in several dance shows. I tried participating in Dance Jodi Dance for two years, and got a spot in the third season. While exploring dance, it felt nice to emote to the songs and showcase various emotions. Later, I got an opportunity to play the lead. I love acting so much — I feel that it has some kind of power. Whenever I am out, people call me ‘Iniyan’. Isn’t it lovely that a character has so much power?”


Puvi also wants to try his luck in films, and is already auditioning for many projects. “I don’t have any reservations and want to play different characters. I just got selected for a project. Let’s see how it pans out,” he smiles.


Having said that, he also believes that acting comes with its own challenges. “When you audition, you tend to pin high hopes when someone says that they’ll call you. Someone had promised me that they will launch me and said that I am the next Atharvaa. They drop different words and names that you get swayed away. There are also people who would cheat you of your money. Someone had asked for `1 lakh from me, promising that they would launch me. Many people come to the industry with stars in their eyes and it is easy for newcomers to get cheated when they enter this field. But I’d say, place the trust on you, your talent and keep trying. I am sure we’d get a breakthrough someday,” he signs off."
"  Nov 27, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,Lung cancer awareness month: Is pollution responsible for Lung Cancer?,"The National Capital has once again slipped into the ‘very poor air quality’ category and with anti-pollution measures being taken to bring down the severity, the exposure to pollutants is still a major risk factor for developing lung cancer. Air pollution levels can put a healthy human being at a huge risk in terms of pulmonary health.
Dr Chandragouda D, Director and HOD medical Oncology, Akash Hospital, Delhi says “Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the vast majority is caused by tobacco smoking but even in the absence of the habit of smoking, present air quality in Delhi is equivalent to inhaling the smoke of at least 30 cigarettes a day. So, environmental causes of cancer, including air pollution, has become a major concern too.”

Dr. Chandra further said that high levels of air pollution triggers the development of diseases like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Acute bronchitis; more than 10 million cases has been reported per year in India and are increasing at an alarming rate among non-smokers as well. COPD is the collective term for a group of conditions that damage tissues in the lungs and airways and this damage affects airflow in and out of the lungs, making breathing difficult.
Lung cancer is a serious and potentially deadly disease that affects a person’s ability to breath. With quality of air being compromised both indoors and outdoors, it has a direct impact on the health of children, expecting mothers, and senior citizens as their immune system is fragile. In case one experiences long stretches of wheezing along with trouble breathing. and feel persistent cough, chest pain and shortness of breath, consult with a doctor immediately as they can provide a more accurate diagnosis, considering the condition.

Prevention is always better than cure, so taking few steps and bringing some lifestyle changes will be helpful to lead a better health.
-Reduce indoor pollution by not using incense sticks or agarbattis
-Quit smoking

-Wear an N95 grade mask while stepping outdoors

-Switch to a healthy diet to strengthen your immune system

-Keep the nasal passage clean with steam and practice regular breathing exercise

-Check the air quality before stepping out and step out only when its necessary


Above all, the Covid-19 pandemic has created more challenge for cancer patients as they are already immune compromised. The coronavirus primarily attacks the lungs and the respiratory tracts. So, anything that harms the lungs can and result in more severe effects if people get infected.

So as a society also, we must take necessary steps and adhere to government guidelines to help reduce pollution and risk of the virus at the same time."

" Nov 27, 2020, 00:18 IST",Anjana George,Entertainment,IM Vijayan: Maradona is my God and God doesn’t die,"Footballer IM Vijayan, calls Diego Maradona who died on Wednesday following a cardiac arrest, as his ‘God’. The former Indian Football captain tells us how the legend will forever inspire him to be a better footballer every day.
Vijayan divulges that he wasn’t an Argentina supporter till 1986. “After watching the Mexican World Cup football match that year, from a friend’s house, I became a Maradona fan. From then I started following the
team. He is magical and it is seen in his every game. I have been trying to perform his skills since then and have never succeeded. No wonder that he called the goal that he scored during England Vs. Argentina match, ‘hand of God’. Even today, the entire world praises that goal. Watching him playing, was a big inspiration for me,” he says.

Vijayan aka Kalo Harin is also known for his acting prowess. The fan in him, Vijayan says, finally, got the opportunity to meet his ‘God’ in 2012 at Kannur during an event. “I consider it as the biggest achievement in my life,” he says.
Talking about that ‘precious’ moment, Vijayan says, “We were told that we can meet him on the previous day of the event. Many Footballers including Sharaf sir, Suresh and Nelson waited for five hours. He slept off and we returned without seeing him. I was disappointed a bit,” he says adding that it later turned out to be a blessing.

“The next day, as I wanted to meet him, I went to the ground. Thus, I was able to share stage with him. I played football for a few minutes and hugged him. There are many in this world who desire at least touch him. Isn’t that called luck?” asks Vijayan adding, “If I had clicked a picture with him on the previous day, I wouldn’t have got to the opportunity to spent such wonderful moments with my God. I would have been happy with what I got and gone back home,” he says.

When heard about Maradona's demise, Vijayan was at Thiruvanathapuram. “I was watching the news and when I heard it, I screamed, ‘Oh God!’. I couldn’t believe it. I really didn’t want to believe. He is my God and God doesn't die,” he says.

Vijayan says, he went through a similar feeling when he heard about Kalabhavan Mani’s demise. “I couldn’t talk to anybody. So, I did not speak to anyone about it till Thursday evening,” he says.


Maradona, according to Vijayan, loved football more than anything in his life. During the event at Kannur, Vijayan recalls that the footballer refused to cut a cake that was in the shape of a football. “He hesitated initially and later, he agreed to cut only the outer part of the cake. That moment I realised how much football and ground meant to him,” he says."
" Nov 27, 2020, 00:40 IST",Neha Maheshwri,TV,"BB14’s Aly Goni’s sister says, ‘Kavita Kaushik is an example of poor sportsmanship’","She has been in the eye of the storm for her volatile equation with the contestants inside the Bigg Boss house. If Kavita Kaushik’s fight with friend-turned-foe Eijaz Khan had viewers arguing amongst themselves on social media, her recent showdown — a fierce verbal duel — with Aly Goni, has become a talking point now. In one of the episodes, Kavita, who was assigned the responsibility of throwing her inmates’ belongings into a trash can, found herself at loggerheads with Aly. Their argument soon turned violent with Aly kicking the trash can in anger and abusing Kavita. While Kavita’s husband Ronnit Biswas has called out Aly for his violent behaviour, the latter’s sister, Ilham Goni Tak accuses the ‘FIR’ actress of instigating people and bringing out the worst in them.
‘Aly can’t control his anger when rubbed the wrong way’
Talking to BT about the ugly spat, Ilham says, “Aly is short-tempered and can’t control his anger when rubbed the wrong way. He has been respectful towards everyone, including Kavita, inside the house. He called her madam, Kavitaji and didi in the beginning. Now, if the equation between two people changes from good to bad, it’s wrong to blame just one person. Both of them should be held responsible for it. Being a senior artiste, Kavita should know how to treat the other person. She has always called Aly gunda, galli ka gunda and small-town boy in a derogatory way that would trigger anybody.”


‘Kavita is an example of poor sportsmanship’ Ilham points out that while Aly tries to ignore Kavita, the latter always finds a way to instigate him. “If you talk about the task in which we saw them break into a fight, Kavita could have started with someone else. She doesn’t have a great equation with Aly and could have played smart by starting with another housemate to make him believe that she wasn’t targeting him. However, she chose to discard Aly’s shoes first. It seemed like a deliberate attempt to target him, which triggered him. Despite that, he respectfully and repeatedly asked her for the reason, but she kept ignoring him. That triggered him further. He erupted in anger when she said ‘Main teri baap hoon’. I am not playing the woman card here. Agar koi ladka, ladki ko yeh bolega toh sab bolenge ki ladka badtameez hai. How is a woman allowed to say such a thing to a man?”

She continues, “A few days ago, Kavita’s friends were tweeting and asking contestants to stop playing the woman card inside the house and show sportsmanship. Why are they quiet now? You can’t twist things and statements to suit you and your friend. Kavita is an example of poor sportsmanship and doesn’t believe in healthy competition. She cribs and complains about others, while she is equally violent with her words. What happened with Aly, has happened with Eijaz as well. Eijaz didn’t disrespect Kavita. I feel that Kavita says a lot of things in anger, which she can’t take back. Later, she tries to justify it by talking to the camera at length. Even after her fight with Aly, she realised that she was wrong and went overboard, which is why she tried to resolve the issue by talking to Jasmin and Aly, and requested them to maintain a cordial equation inside the house. She replaced the word gunda with naughty while talking to Aly the next day, because she realised that it won’t work with him. She must have realised that she can’t get away with saying anything to people. It’s better to think before you speak, so that you don’t end up hurting them.”

‘Kavita provokes people and instigates them’
Ilham says that Aly was provoked, which is why he lost his cool. “I can’t tolerate people blaming Aly when he isn’t wrong. I would be the first one to point out his mistake. During one of the episodes, when he tried to break open the door before his quarantine period ended, I said that he should have stayed calm and not lost his cool. But in this case, Kavita has perpetually been provoking him. She even said something very distasteful (friends with benefits) to Rubina Dilaik on national television. That is not acceptable. You can’t justify every act of yours. We respect you for your seniority, but that doesn’t give you the right to say anything to people. She provokes people and instigates them in a way that reactions are bound to come out. I am not blaming her entirely, as I am not sure whether she thinks before she speaks. I feel sorry for her because I don’t think anyone can speak such bad and mean things deliberately. She says things and regrets later. She is now trying to please people, but the damage is done,” she says.


‘Aly is fun-loving, but can’t tolerate his family being dragged into an argument’

Point out how Aly also told Kavita ‘main tera baap hoon’ in a fit of rage and she replies, “Whenever there is an argument, it boils down to who started it. In her case, she starts it all the time. She has no right to drag anyone’s parents in an argument. Aly is fun-loving, but can’t tolerate his family being dragged into an argument. She knows that’s Aly’s weak point and still chose to hurt him. Kavita’s choice of words has always been distasteful. It’s strange to see her initiate arguments and then complain to Bigg Boss on being wrongfully cornered and targeted.”


Talking about her brother’s shortcomings and strengths as a player, Ilham says, “He has to control his anger because it can affect his game. He is smart and sensible. He is not disrespectful towards anybody, let alone women. Also, a person can’t be judged on the basis of his reaction to an instigation. I would request everyone to watch every episode to date.”


‘People are blowing things out of proportion’

Tell her how Kavita’s husband was suggested by his relatives to file a complaint against Aly and she says, “I think they are blowing things out of proportion. Isn’t he upset about the way Kavita is behaving with other inmates? Isn’t he upset about Kavita instigating and saying mean things to people on national TV? He should be upset about that as well. Abhinav (Shukla) can also file a complaint for her trying to cause discord in his marriage with Rubina. Phir toh defamation par defamation hoga ‘Bigg Boss’ ke ghar mein.”"

"  Nov 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,How to make the best use of your winter veggies this season,"Winter brings a bounty of several green leafy vegetables that can be used to make perfect dishes for the season. Root vegetables like radish, knol khol and others can be used in more ways than one including their green leaves. Here's how you can make use of some of the seasonal vegetables that are easily available now...
Cook root vegetables along with their leaves
Nutrition and wellness consultant Sheela Krishnaswamy says that in this season, one must include root vegetables in their diet. ""While carrots are not usually available with their leaves, others like radish and knol khol are. Instead of discarding the leaves, one can use these for stir fry. This is a good way to combine leafy greens in your diets, along with the vegetables. The leaves can also be cooked with dal or mixed with flour to make chapatis,"" Sheela shares, adding, ""They are high in fibre, iron - especially the dark green leafy ones - and also contain calcium and beta carotene.""


Load up on Brussels sprouts Restaurateur Prathik Shetty says that one of the most popular dishes at their restaurant is a simple sautéed Brussels sprouts dish. ""Not only does it taste delicious, but is also available in surplus during winter. Brussels sprouts contain plenty of vitamins and proteins. Sautéed brussels sprouts are simple yet flavourful and can be made at home easily,"" Prathik says.

Don't forget your beans
Sheela adds that the number of dishes one can make with avarekai is endless. ""This is a winter specialty in Karnataka and it is loaded with fiber and proteins. Whether it is dosa, idly, sambhar or rasam one can experiment a lot with these beans,"" says Sheela.

"  Nov 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,Tovino: I found it tough to carry the Cane Corso in one of the scenes,"This year, especially the time away from work during the lockdown, has probably brought Tovino Thomas closer to animals than ever before. It is also why a Cane Corso, an Italian breed of mastiff, features prominently in his ‘man vs wild’ thriller titled Kala, which has Divya Pillai as the female lead.
Its director Rohith VS tells us, “The Cane Corso that is named Bazigar in the film, looks like a panther and can be very intimidating. But within two days, it became friendly with all of us. The mastiff is the pet of Tovino’s character Shaji in Kala and so, he was the one who handled it completely on the sets. In fact, he was the one who selected the breed for the movie.”

It wasn’t a random suggestion by the actor either as he was introduced to the mastiff during the lockdown when he was training his beagle Pablo. Tovino says, “My friend Christo runs a dog-training academy and hostel, which is near my place. During the lockdown, he connected me to the owners of Pablo, which is in fact my first pet. So, after the lockdown rules were relaxed, I used to take Pablo to his hostel, where he also trains in animal behavioural correction. I have always been interested in animals and these techniques.”
Talking about how he became at ease with dogs, he says, “The Italian mastiff has an even temperament, but it is massively powerful and can be ferocious. Christo chettan says that animals can sense our intentions and so, if we are friendly with them, they too will reciprocate. Now, after the initial assessment of any animal’s mood, I feel I can handle them.”

On how a foreign breed like Cane Corso fits into the story of Kala, Tovino says, “The movie is set in the ‘90s and we have conceived my character as one of the first Malayalis to have imported a Cane Corso with the intention of owning an expensive foreign breed. However, we don’t reveal all these details in the movie. In life, I am someone who loves dogs, but my character Shaji is more of a dog enthusiast.”


So, what were the challenges of working with the large mastiff that can weigh 40-50kg? “I had to carry it in one scene and I had to cross a wooden bridge with it in another; those were the difficult scenes,” says the actor. “Dogs react to external stimuli; like to make it bark, you tie a goat nearby. But sometimes, it’s hard to control them. The leash that I normally use for my dog is easy for me to grip, but for the movie, we had to use a different one that I had to curl around my hands. So, whenever Bazigar decided to bolt, it would bruise my hands. But it was an interesting experience.”


Meanwhile, Divya, who plays Shaji’s wife Vidya in the film, tells us about her experience working with the mastiff. “She looks very fierce, but after a while she becomes friendly and is just a lap dog you want to cuddle. It was nice to work with her.”


Elaborating further on the film, Tovino says, “It’s got a simple story, but has a lot of layers. It’s about how people behave with others. For instance, how you react with your parents wouldn’t be how you are with your children or friends, workers or a dog.”


The film’s shoot, which was halted after Tovino’s injury during its action scenes, is set to resume once the actor completes his portions of his current project Kaanekkaane. “We have about 16 more days of shoot left and for now we have finished editing whatever we have shot till now,” concludes Rohith."
"  Nov 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Ashish Ittyerah Joseph,Lifestyle,These kindhearted Chennaiites go the extra mile to rescue stranded animals in the flood,"Even as most people braced themselves for Cyclone Nivar and stayed indoors, a group of animal rescuers has been busy carrying out their work in the last few days, including the day of the cyclone, to ensure that they could save as many stray animals as possible. As groups and individuals, these animal lovers, as in the past during similar instances like 2015 Chennai floods and Vardah, have been doing everything possible to move stray animals to safer places, treat those injured and find safe homes for as many of them as possible.
Arjun S of Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary says the cyclone wasn’t as intense as expected and therefore the rescues weren’t that complex. “But we see Nivar rescues as a pre-op at this point for any future calamities,” he says. According to Arjun, the list of animals they rescued included 10 injured dogs, four cats and a couple of disoriented birds. Kirthana Raamsukaesh from Hope for Critters says that they have been rescuing stranded animals since November 24 and it will hopefully be over by today. “We don’t have a hospital or shelter. But we rescue, rehabilitate and release them back in the same locality once it’s safe outside or try to find someone to adopt them,” says Kirthana, recalling how they rescued an eight-day-old puppy that got stranded in a water-clogged plot in Velachery after it got separated from its mother.


Even as they continue rescue operations in Chennai, a group of rescuers from Blue Cross of India have gone to Marakkanam to rescue animals there. “We felt the maximum help would be required there as cyclone landfall was in that area. Our disaster management team, headed by our GM, Dawn Williams, has gone there to assess the situation and do the needful,” says Sathya Radhakrishnan, Honorary Joint Secretary, Blue Cross of India.

“Two vehicles with the team, cattle feed/dog food and medical supplies, have gone to Marakkanam,” adds Sathya.


While rescue is one part of the job, they're also creating awareness. Sai Vignesh, an animal activist from Thiruvallur, says, “Part of my job during this cyclone was to raise awareness among people and urge them to foster and shelter injured or homeless strays. On Tuesday, I rescued around six newborn puppies, who had lost their mother in a road accident because of the heavy rains.” Arjun adds, “Meanwhile, we got about 150 calls from people who were looking to abandon their pets during the cyclone. It is quite sad that even during tough times like these, people think about abandoning their pets.”


Apart from dogs, cats and cattle, snakes, too, were rescued. “We had many calls for the rescue of snakes such as Russell’s Vipers. Snakes enter houses during floods since water fills the ground level. We tended to multiple such rescues in the city, especially in water-logged areas like Semmencheri, in coordination with the state's forest department,” says Arjun. Forest range officer, Clement Edison, says, “We would have done over 100 rescues in different parts of the city in these two days. As soon as you see a snake, close the doors and windows of that room, and contact us. Or if spotted outside, place a basket on top of it. And if you are scared, at least have someone watch out from a distance as to where it has moved. We’ll come and rescue it. We also rescued a few owls.”"

He is now busy with his next in Bollywood, Love You Shankar, and also has another lined up. The model turned actor says the break between his first appearance to his next was deliberate.

""After my role in Dear Zindagi, I didn't want to rush and sign something to keep myself busy. I wanted to ensure I took time to understand acting and brushed up my skills. I always wanted to get into acting, so I took time to do it right,"" says Prateik, who has been shooting for Love You Shankar, directed by Rajiv S Ruia.


""This story travels from London to Uttar Pradesh. It is a very emotional story and I play an aspiring singer and father based in London. He ends up travelling along with his child to India due to some circumstances,"" says Prateik, adding that there is another film that will show him in a completely different shade, that will take off shortly.

Prateik, who grew up in Basavanagudi, says he is very much comfortable speaking Kannada and also manages Tamil and Telugu like most Bengalureans do. ""I did a role in Venky Mama in Telugu recently, and it was comfortable to speak those Telugu dialogues. I would love to do films in Kannada for sure. I can fluently speak the language and would also love exploring other South Indian languages. I admire people like Kabir Duhan Singh, who have come from the world of modelling and carved a niche for themselves in the film industry,"" he signs off."
"  Nov 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Ashish Ittyerah Joseph,Lifestyle,"Karthigai Deepam: More than COVID-19, rains affected lamp production","This Sunday will truly be the festival of lights, as people come together to celebrate Karthigai Deepam by lighting traditional kuthu vilakku, yaanai vilakku and multiple mann vilakku. Buying new clay lamps is a tradition at most households during the festival, but did you know that these vilakkus are mostly made by potters from Thiruneermalai, near Chrompet?

Work was on at full swing when we visited the village — some were working their magic on potters’ wheels, moulding the last few batches of lamps, while others were sun-drying the finished ones. “On an average, each person makes 50,000 lamps during the season. People in this village have been doing this for more than 100 years,” says Sathiamoorthy, a fifth-generation potter, adding, “But the number of people doing it is fewer these days and that itself is a challenge, considering there is still good demand for clay items.”


Kannappan, who has been in this profession for almost 50 years, says, “Our lamps are sold in shops across the city — Vadapalani, Kodambakkam, Mylapore, Pallavaram, Ayanavaram, Medavakkam, Tambaram. They are sent to neighbouring districts, too. However, prices have dropped a bit. Bulk order of 1000 lamps costs `700. But we still pay `15,000 for one load of clay.”

Is the drop in price because of the pandemic? “Not really. Even when other businesses were shut, we still had work,” says Sathiamoorthy. His father, Krishnan, interrupts, “But the rains affected production.”


How lamps are made by potters
First, clay is bought to make the deepams (about a lakh small lamps can be made from one truck of clay). The clay is stored in a shed with asbestos roof, and covered with a sack.
The required clay is kneaded well and taken to the wheel, where it is shaped to form lamps.
Clay lamps, these days, are made on an electric wheel, whereas bigger ones are shaped on the manual wheel.
The finished ones are sun-dried on the village roads.
Once dry, the lamps are baked to strengthen them and prevent from breaking.
The baked lamps are hand-painted before being dispatched todifferent locations"
"  Nov 28, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sharanya CR,Entertainment,Vani Bhojan character will be a mystery in Casino,"Vani Bhojan and Madhampatty Rangaraj (of Mehandi Circus and Penguin fame) team up for a thriller titled, Casino. The film directed by debutant Mark Joel will also have director John Mahendran making his acting debut through this film.

Says Mark, “This is a thriller and most parts of the film happens in a night’s time, and at a single location. Both Rangaraj and Vani don’t play the conventional hero-heroine. In fact, all the characters in the film have grey shades. Vani’s character, though, will be a mystery. She plays Maya and adds the necessary ‘maayai’ to the film. Rangaraj essays the role of Sanjay. He was comfortable to work with and is very supportive of the film.”


So, how did he manage to rope in John Mahendran for the film? “John sir has written the additional dialogues and screenplay for the film. He plays a character called John. When I wrote the character, I felt he would be apt for the film. People don’t know how good an actor he is and I hope to show that side of him through my film,” says Mark.

Music is by Indie composer Stanley Xavier, and cinematography is by Vignesh JK. “All of us are newcomers. I’ve always been fascinated by films ever since I was a child. I’ve been editing television commercials and also did a few short films. This is a screenplay I’d written sometime ago. In fact, the spark came from an incident that happened to me in 2017. Films like Amores Perros and Pisaasu inspired me to work on a film that happens at a single location. I am so glad to be working on this film, and with this team,” he says. The team wrapped up the first schedule in Coimbatore and will begin their next in a week’s time."

The heritage enthusiasts of the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar paid a visit to Madhu Smriti — the home of Utkal Gourav Madhusudan Das — as part of the Cuttack Heritage Walk. It was a great opportunity for young participants to know more about Das, one of the founding fathers of modern Odisha. He was popularly called Madhu Babu and his career was studded with many firsts.


Around 31 people from various walks of life weathered the morning chill to take part in the walk. The enthusiasm of knowing more about these historical places and monuments of the city had brought them together. As usual, the walk started from the Barabati fort.

“We visited Madhu Smriti and watched the Madhusudan Sangrahalaya from outside, as it was closed. Our historians explained everything about Madhu babu to the participants. There were several youngsters who were keenly observing and listening to the speakers,” said organiser Deepak Samantray.


Madhusudan Das had created the Utkal Sammilani, which united Odia speaking people spread over a large area and facilitated the formation of Odisha, the first language-based Indian state in 1936. “Many youngsters are unaware of him and such walks are needed for the young generation to know about one of the founding fathers of the state,” said Hitesh Seth, a participant."

“Since my film’s shoot was halted in March has not resumed yet, I decided to invest my time in fine tuning my dance skills. So, I am training under Akash, who is also a choreographer for my film. I have been working hard on some new steps and few difficult moves under his watchful eyes. I’m open to learning new things and the pandemic gave me the opportunity,” said the actor.

He added that all his efforts are dedicated to his fans, who always want something new from him. In last one year, he transformed his physique by hitting the gym and working out harder. He has changed his physical appearance from a chocolate boy look to a stud with six-pack abs and a chiseled face. “I have no releases this year. So, my fans will get to see something new from me in the coming year,” he said. He is cast opposite Sivani Sangita in Bidyaran, which is directed by Joyte Das.


Akash, who has worked with several Bollywood stars, has been in the city due to the pandemic and is working with Babushaan. He is all praise for the actor, his enthusiasm and never-say-die attitude."

"  Nov 29, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sruthi Raman,Lifestyle,Postcards of love: Bringing back the art of letter-writing,"Letter-writing might be a lost art, but not everyone is accepting the fall. BTS, the Grammy-nominated K-pop sensation recently surprised their fans world over (also known officially as the ARMY) with handwritten postcards. And closer home in Chennai, Latha Menon, a filmmaker and storyteller, is trying to revive the lost art through her recent project.
Titled Travel Stories by Latha, the filmmaker explores different cities across the world in a bid to revive the magic of postcards. The project stemmed from her decades-long fascination with letter writing. “I am fond of writing letters and believe in the joy of receiving a note from someone. And I thought why not make something really compact where people can write four lines and communicate,” she says, adding that she chose to capture some of the most striking aspects of architecture and landscapes in cities like Brussels, Hanoi and Cannes for the postcards.

The postcards contain snapshots from her experiences in these towns through the years. “I explored different cities like Brussels and Cannes through vignettes of different kinds of landscapes and the skies,” she points out, adding that the common denominator in all of these postcards ended up being the colour blue. “Blue skies are predominant in my work. I wanted to capture how a place makes you feel. You get a sense of the particular culture, the context and the cobblestones of the place through these cards. I have also tried to focus a lot on the architecture,” she says.

The intention was also to urge people to communicate their feelings by putting pen on paper. “People have forgotten how to write by hand. If you can write succinctly on Twitter, you might as well write succinctly on a postcard. Postcard is also about the art of writing a short story. A lot of people think letter writing is a long process. I wanted to show them that it could be short, too,” she adds.


The pandemic-ridden year also lent itself well to the theme of postcards, the filmmaker notes. “This year has been very introspective. We have all come to realise the importance of community and communication. Initially during the pandemic, everyone went into their shells. But now everybody knows that it is important to share. When there is a hard copy that is reaching you with a handwritten note, there is nothing more beautiful,” Latha observes.


Her relationships with letters go a long way. “As a young girl, I had a pen pal from Germany. We used to exchange gifts and continued that friendship and through school and college. I remember being excited to come back home just to read that letter. My very dear friend who passed away at 18 in an accident, used to write me letters. I still have the letter that she wrote to me from Trivandrum. She comes alive every time I read her words and that is what a letter does,” Latha recalls, adding that a portion of the proceeds from the postcards would go to Suyam charitable trust."
"  Nov 29, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Lifestyle,Bioluminescence witnessed on the Karavali coast,"The beaches along the Karavali coast, including Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, have been witnessing a rare, but dazzling activity over the past week. The waters in the region have been glowing a luminous blue, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence. “But this is definitely not a healthy sign,” points out professor Vel, dean of College of Fisheries, Mangaluru. Sharing that the phenomenon occurs due to the presence of a variety of algae called the Dinoflaggelate, Vel avers that this kind of activity is in fact harmful for the the water. “And it is usually caused by pollutants like sewage and effluents, rise in temperature and increased turbulence of the water. Whether it’s from ships, intra-state flow of water or marine pollution by other factors, is something that needs to be ascertained. My team is currently conducting research on the same,” shares professor Vel.

Meanwhile, Ashwin Rai, another fisheries expert and marine enthusiast, seconds the fact that bioluminescence does indicate a change of ecology. “It is harmful for the water as it depletes oxygen levels and has a direct impact on marine life, especially fish. This kind of algae is not the preferred fuel of fish and may even cause them to move away from the region. But whether this is a temporary change or a long-lasting effect remains to be seen. If it turns out to be a long-lasting one, then it is a matter of grave concern,” concurs Ashwin.

Locals though, are excited about this unique event along their shoreline. “We have been going to witness the sight every other day post 10 pm. It is surreal to say the least,” says Sumana Pai, a homemaker. Even the huge crowds and surging traffic doesn’t deter Pooja Chirag and her family from going all the way to Padukere to watch this phenomenon. Photographer Varun Shetty was on the beach with his family on the first day that Mangaluru witnessed bioluminescent activity. “I had spotted such luminous waters on a fishing trip a few years ago, off the coast of Mangaluru. But it seems like this is the first time that it’s lasted this long. While the waters do look beautiful, I’m also aware that bioluminescence is not a healthy trend and hope our waters regain their original freshness soon,” Varun sums up.

The film is set to be a historical and Ravichandran will be seen in the role of a scholar whose family has been preserving Kannada and its literary heritage through generations. Now, we have exclusively learnt that the filmmakers have shot for a sequence that showcases Ravichandran as a warrior, and this is an important part of the narrative. Talking about this, producer NS Rajkumar reveals, ""Ravichandran sir plays Samanthabhadra, who was a chief in Queen Chennabhairadevi's army. This is the first time that he plays a historical role like this. This character is an ancestor of Gunabhadra, who is the protagonist of the film and the character that Ravichandran sir plays in the film.""

"  Nov 29, 2020, 00:00 IST",Joyeeta Chakravorty,Lifestyle,Work From Home upgrades that you should consider investing in,"If work from home was a luxury only a few were accorded earlier, the pandemic has changed that around with everyone who can work from home doing just that. So much so that today there’s a growing populace of employees who are setting up workstations at home, with adequate technology and gadgets to function in a comfortable and productive environment. As we count down to the new year and corporates look at a fresh season of Work from Home (WFH) with employees who need more than a bean bag and a laptop, we speak to employees and tech experts about the kind of upgrades that work out best for those working from home.

UPGRADE THAT LAPTOP

With an array of offers and deals online, this is also a great time to let go of your old laptop or the space consuming desktop and bring home something compact and comfortable. Technology reviewer Nirmal TV points out, “When choosing a laptop, look for one with a good display and camera. There are options to upgrade the external camera for various budgets too. Make sure to invest in a laptop that has a minimum of 8GB of RAM and supporting drives, as these perform much faster than the drives on the hard disk.”
INCREASE BANDWITH, STAY CONNECTED
With long MS Team calls and Zoom meetings with clients and bosses, an uninterrupted internet service is a given. “The first thing to get is a router UPS that will ensure uninterrupted internet coverage even if your power goes off,” says Youtuber Sandeep Sarma. “A dedicated 5G spectrum bandwidth from a mobile service provider is mandatory. Companies are already paying internet charges and mobile bills to their employees – instead they could negotiate for a dedicated bandwidth with a service provider too,” says Vadivel Devarajan, Senior Program Director at an IT services firm. “Poor network connectivity issues have been a common complaint. With more devices connected to WiFi, it might be a wise choice to upgrade to a more capable router for better speed,” says tech reviewer and Youtuber Lakshmi Rajan.

ERGONOMIC CHAIRS AND STANDING DESKS MINIMISE POSTURE-RELATED INJURIES

Sitting is new smoking. Sitting for long hours is recipe for health hazards, and with work from home, the hours have only increased. The ideal way out here is to opt for a standing desk, which is quite in right now. Alternate between sitting and standing as you work from home. “A lot of us who are working from home are still working from our dining tables, couches or even our beds and each of these are bad for your posture. We began with the idea of this being a temporary set up, but companies are choosing to extend work from home for longer into the new year. From a health perspective, it makes sense to invest in a good ergonomic chair or even a height adjustable standing desk. When you are required to work for more than eight hours a day, this becomes a necessary upgrade,” advises Lakshmi.


MOVE FREELY WITH USB DESK MIC AND WIRELESS EARPHONES

With a wide selection of good microphones available online, now is the best time to purchase one, suggest tech geeks. Youtuber and tech reviewer Giridhar Chandrasekar recommends, “Get yourself a good USB desk mic in order to be heard clearly in your calls and meetings. Most laptops and mobiles come with inbuilt mics, but using a desk mic is a convenient option that also offers better voice clarity.

Online, these mics cost anywhere from Rs. 2,500 upwards.” Lakshmi adds, “A wireless earphone is another must-have gadget that allows you to move around, reach out for things while you are online, without getting entangled in wires. Opt for either the wireless neck-band type or the Truly Wireless (TWS) earphones. But do pick up one that offers a good mic as a prominent feature.”


A PRINTER IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR

Despite working in paperless offices, one might suddenly find the need to print something, especially those with kids at home. Giridhar suggests, “Ink-tank printers are highly recommended for WFH setups. These printers may cost up to Rs. 10,000, but prove to be cost effective in the long run and even if you use them occasionally, the printer head of the ink does not dry up like it does with inkjet printers.”"

Harish Raj, who is currently seen on the comedy show Majaa Bharatha, will be a part of the devotional serial Yediyur Siddhalingeshwara, directed by Naveen Krishna. The show traces the life of Yediyur Siddhalingeshwara, a revered Sharana saint and will have Vinay Gowda playing Shiva. Harish Raj says, “I play the younger version of Mallikarjuna, Siddhalingeshwara’s father, who has to deal with his son’s spiritual leaning and worldly knowledge, which leads to people revering him. When I get roles like this, I feel it’s a divine calling as I am a firm believer and not often does one get opportunities to play such characters. In movies, I have played a role like this, but on the small screen it will be the first time that I will be acting in a devotional serial.""

As for Majaa Bharatha, he adds, “My role is to bridge a gap between host and judges. I have appeared as a student, grandmother and college student on the show. I am thoroughly enjoying the work in Majaa Bharatha.” On the film front, the actor is awaiting for the release of Khiladi Police."

Slowly and gradually, I realised I was head-over-heels in love and started pursuing her. Initially, she wanted to be ‘just friends', because we were both very young and needed to focus on our careers. Like every relationship, we have seen a lot of ups-and-downs over the last 10 years. Marriage is just a formality between us now, which hopefully should also happen by November or December.""

"  Nov 29, 2020, 01:00 IST",Rachana Dubey,Entertainment,Ishaan Khatter: Comedy is one of the hardest genres to crack,"In the two years that Ishaan Khatter has been a part of the industry, he has made some unconventional film choices, which have helped him stand out and make a mark. He debuted with Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi’s Beyond The Clouds, played a taxi driver in Khaali Peeli and is gearing up for an unusual comedy with Katrina Kaif and Siddhant Chaturvedi, titled Phone Booth.

Talking about what drives his professional choices, Ishaan says, “I’m mostly driven by instinct. There’s a great desire to reinvent and push myself into a space that I haven’t explored before, and to learn with each film. That largely dictates my choices. I want to work with certain people and I crave for experiences I can grow with. The opportunity a film gives me as an actor and the people I would possibly get to work and create with are major motivators. Other than that, it’s all about what the script makes me feel. It could make me laugh, cry, grip me or fascinate me — as long as it moves me in some way.”


Talking about his experiences as an actor, he shares, “You’ll obviously have challenging experiences with the different choices that you make. Certain scenes and characters are more difficult than others as far as connecting to them or accurately portraying them is concerned. I think that in the larger scheme of things, self-preservation is crucial. To constantly be in a healthy mind space and be consistent in your work can be challenging. As an actor, most people agree that comedy is one of the hardest things to crack. It is in equal parts exciting and challenging for me.”

When asked whether he feels that making unconventional choices pays off, he says, “Conventional and unconventional are relative terms. These are labels given by other people. When you are making a choice, these aren’t necessarily the things that you’re thinking of. But having said that, yes, a lot of actors are known for their unconventional choices, so to say. But at the same time, it’s important to be truthful to yourself and make choices that are an honest representation of who you are as an actor or an artiste. I think that’s more important.” Attachments area"

A few days later, he dived deep into work to distract himself from the loss he had suffered. After completing the patchwork for a forthcoming film, the actor is busy prepping for choreographer Bosco Martis’ directorial debut Rocket Gang.

“For the first 15 days, it didn’t sink in that I would no longer get to see my father. It took more than a fortnight to come to terms with this loss. My sister and mom were miserable, but I had to hold fort. One night, it suddenly hit me that I will never really see my dad again. That’s when I broke down and would often cry, but only when I would be alone. On the sets, I tried not to think about it. I would never have liked to feel like a grown-up man this way,” says Aditya.


Aditya says that it was his father’s work ethic that inspired him to return to the set soon after the personal loss. He shares, “It was difficult to deal with losing my father suddenly, but I knew that he would have wanted me to get back to work. He started working at 14 and worked till the age of 61. Wherever we are in life, is because he worked hard for it. I hope to be as relentless towards work as he was. I have a lot more responsibility towards my mother and sister now. My mother has been a homemaker all her life. Suddenly, her world has changed. I plan to help her be a little more independent, starting with working on brushing up her driving skills and teaching her net banking. I want her to feel confident about managing these things on her own.”

While on set, Aditya is extremely cautious and ensures that people around him, too, take the pandemic seriously. He says, “My father was doing well, but suddenly his condition worsened in the last three days. Whenever I am on the set, I am a lot more cautious, because I don’t want to put anyone’s health at risk. I carry four sanitisers, two masks, gloves, the works... I ensure that I follow all the precautionary measures. In fact, I didn’t go back home when I was shooting. I stayed elsewhere, so that people at home would be safe.”"

"  Nov 30, 2020, 00:00 IST",Sandra Marina Fernandes,Lifestyle,Get winter ready with the right hues and prints,"Have you been waiting for the temperature to drop so that you can pull out your favourite winter wear from the wardrobe? While you are now layering up to stay warm, make sure to be on point as far as being trendy goes. Whether it is a cosy evening out with friends and families, a lazy brunch over the weekend, or having guests over, this time of the year is for the darker, warmer shades. With the temperatures dipping and the occasional drizzle in the city, here's what designers and stylists suggest you should be wearing…


Polka dots never cease to impress
Celebrity stylist and designer Nishara Kiran, says, ""Polka dots have been a fashion favourite over the years and are definitely here to stay. Polka dots add a retro touch to outfits and can be styled in various colours and sizes. One thing about polka dots is that it can help you dress up or down.




Darker tones to the rescue

Artist-turned-designer Rakshitha Srinivas suggests, ""Warm tones work best for the cold weather, like, for instance, deep reds, maroons, browns, rust, yellow, etc. I prefer solid colours with no prints, but self motifs work well too. ""Geometric patterns are also in this season. For those who prefer traditional outfits, an attire in bright raw silk with full sleeves is just right,"" says Rakshitha.




Wear floral prints to make a statement

Florals or psychedelic floral prints are another big trend this season. ""Florals prints are refreshing to style as outfits. Extra large floral prints on flared pants or a boho maxi dress are enough to make quite a statement. Flared printed pants or a denim midi skirt with a turtleneck top, accessorised with a big headband can add quite a vintage charm. Make sure to go easy on other accessories when wearing extra large floral prints,"" says Nishara.




Dive into the tie-dye trend

A print that is not new to us seems to have taken over the global fashion stage and is being used by many luxury design houses these days. ""Tie-dyes are creating a huge splash in both desi and western designs - be it a nice tie-dye lehenga to attend a mehendi or a smart co-ord set for a party. Tie-dye bomber and denim jackets are a new street style favourite,"" Nishara adds.



Black and gold with a touch of quirk

Designer Shravanti Shivkumar says that given how unpredictable rains can be in the city, one must choose fuss-free outfits. ""Flowy outfits may be ruined because of the rains. In terms of prints, motifs of animal prints or human figurines are good. Block prints too are quite popular,"" says Shravanthi, adding, ""Embroidered blouses with full sleeves work well for a night out. Black and gold are classics and never go out of style,"" says Shravanthi.





Add a pop of colour to this dull year


Designer Runaa Ray says for the coming months, bright colours will be great. ""This year has been such a chaos that wearing bright colours can bring in some life and happiness. Some colours that I would suggest are fuschia, emerald greens, black and whites in high contrasts. Different shades of blues are great too. If you have a solid jacket, then wear a scarf in a contrasting shade. If you're wearing plaids, add a pop of colour with your accessories,"" she says."
"  Nov 30, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,Sandy’s debut as hero is a horror thriller,"Tucked away in Mangadu, this house was bustling with people, lights and cameras. As we stepped inside, an intense death scene was being shot. With Sandy, Reshma Pasupuleti, Rama and a group of actors dressed as policemen filming for this sequence, director Nambikkai Chandru ensured the shoot progressed smoothly. Choreographer Sandy is making his acting debut in this untitled film, which has newbie Shruthi playing the female lead. The film is said to be a horror thriller.

Speaking to us about the film, Chandru said, “This is my debut film. I have always been passionate about films and have been trying out my luck in the industry for a while. Eventually, my sister decided to produce my film. This is a time-based horror film. I am launching Sandy as a hero and this will be an interesting role. We are shooting the film in Chennai, and most of the shoot is happening inside a house.”


In addition to Rama and Reshma, Mime Gopi and Saravanan will also be seen in important roles. Chandru added, “The team is technically strong. Since it’s a straight horror film, our cinematographer Sathish has worked his magic with his lens. The shoot will continue for a few more days.”
‘The film shows me in a different avatar’

We get many horror comedies, but there are very few pure horror films. This is a pure pei padam. While people have seen me in lighter roles, this film will show me in a different avatar. The script is engaging and has several suspense elements. The film has come out very well so far!
– Sandy, actor

‘The team is very supportive’

I am making my debut through this film and I am very excited. I play a soft-spoken girl who comes from a humble background. Since I am a newcomer, the team is very supportive. They keep motivating me to give my best.
– Shruthi, actress

‘My character is a suspense’

It is an amazing film and I loved the script when director Chandru narrated it to me. I am not allowed to reveal details about my role, but I can say that it will be a revelation. I learnt a lot through this film, and handled difficult scenes with ease.

Samyuktha made her entry into the house on the launch day (October 4). She got evicted from the house on day 56 at the end of the eighth weekend.

Seven contestants, namely, Aari Arjuna, Balaji Murugadoss, Anitha Sampath, Som Shekar, Aranthangi Nisha, Jithan Ramesh and Sanam Shetty were nominated initially. Anitha used the ‘Nomination Topple’ card and escaped nomination and instead nominated Samyuktha instead of her.
Aari and Balaji were saved on Saturday's episode. Som, Sanam and Nisha were saved from the danger zone on Sunday's episode. It was left with Samyuktha and Ramesh. Finally, Kamal showed Samyuktha’s name as the contestant getting evicted for the week and asked her to join him on the stage.

Samyuktha was sad about leaving the house as she wasn’t nominated initially.

Samyuktha asked the housemates to have a little dance and song session with her. She shook legs with them and moved out of the house.

Kamal welcomed Samyuktha on stage. Samyuktha said she is going through mixed feelings. She is sad about getting evicted from the house and happy that she would be meeting her family members.

Samyuktha added that she is delighted to have won many hearts inside the house. It feels like tough luck to get nominated by the ‘Nomination Topple’ card and getting evicted from the show.

"  Nov 30, 2020, 00:00 IST",,Entertainment,Naseeruddin Shah: I missed the stage so much that there were withdrawal symptoms,"After eight long months, Naseeruddin Shah stepped on the stage at Prithvi Theatre once again. This time, to perform Gabriel Emanuel’s 'Einstein' that’s directed by actress-wife Ratna Pathak Shah. The pandemic forced him to stop doing what he loves the most, and he admits that there were “major withdrawal symptoms”. In a conversation with BT, he spoke about how he coped with staying away from the stage for a long time, taking live performances into the digital world and gearing up to perform for a smaller audience in current times. Read on…
Was this the longest you were away from stage?
I would think it is definitely the longest I’ve stayed away from the stage, and it felt like cold turkey. The only other time I’ve not been on stage this long was while shooting The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), which was a colossal bore to shoot (and later to watch), but what made it bearable was that I was making an obscene amount of money from it. I spent those six months memorising 'The Prophet'.


How difficult was it to stay away from the stage — performance and direction? Which of the two did you miss more? I missed it so much that I visited Prithvi Theatre just to be there and because I felt like hugging that stage. I have to say that there were major withdrawal symptoms. Whether I missed directing or acting more is hard to say because acting gives meaning to my life, but guiding young actors has become a sort of mission for me now. In fact, at times I enjoy it more than acting myself, and when you see youngsters achieving their true potential, it’s far more gratifying than doing it yourself.

During the lockdown, you staged performances online, did it in any way make up for not being in front of a live audience?
Nothing can compensate for the high of being on stage in front of people, but performing without an audience has its own challenges and advantages. In time, we will conquer the challenges and figure out the advantages fully because performing online does seem to be an inescapable part of the future.


Did you choose 'Einstein' to be your first performance after this long break because it’s a solo act and wouldn’t require a larger crew?

I would have preferred to start with an ensemble piece like 'Aurat Aurat Aurat' or 'Manto Ismat Hazir Hain', but that would have involved getting too many people together for rehearsal. I can rehearse Einstein on my own. This time I had about a week to prepare.


Do you think people are ready to return to watch plays and films?

The Prithvi regulars, despite missing going there, will probably hesitate a bit to venture out, but for us, it means giving our best even if no one is present.


Do you plan to stage more performances?

We have announced 'Aurat Aurat Aurat' for December 19 and 20, and depending on the actors’ and technicians’ commitments, and availability of theatres, we will announce more shows and launch into the new ones. In fact, I have already done the basic spadework for all the projects and have even started working on a solo piece about Clarence Darrow (famous and controversial American defense attorney)."
"  Nov 30, 2020, 01:00 IST",Divya Kaushik,TV,"Ssumier Pasricha: For the first time in the last 20 years, I have stayed in Delhi for so long","Almost 10 years ago, Ssumier Pasricha moved to Mumbai to pursue acting as a full-time career, but in the last one year things have changed. The actor, who appeared in TV shows like 'Sasural Simar Ka' and 'Tenali Rama' and is famous as Pammi Aunty on social media, has mostly been in Delhi for the last one year, with occasionally flying to Mumbai for shooting. “I have never spent so much time in Delhi in the past 20 years. Personally, I like Mumbai, but I am in Delhi for the time being. Last year, I lost my dad so it was important for me to give time to my pharmaceuticals business here, and most importantly, be with my mom,” he says, adding, “Then the pandemic happened and I got stuck here. But for me, it was a blessing as I could give time to my business and my family. I will be in Delhi now and business is my priority, but I’ll keep travelling to Mumbai for work. I just returned from there after a month-long shoot and will be leaving again in December,” says Ssumier who is back to acting almost after a year.

“I made my singing debut, something that I always wanted to do. In fact, I always wanted to be a singer but ended up being an actor. Now that I have made my singing debut, I will try and continue with it,” he adds.


The actor, who was last seen in Tenali Rama on TV, says that after getting popular as Pammi Aunty, he has mostly been getting comic roles. He says, “It is tough to break that image of Pammi Aunty. Initially, when I wanted to do comedy, nobody wanted to give me comic roles as I was doing serious shows then. This was in 2011-13 when I was doing Sasural Simar Ka. I would audition for comedy shows and they would not take me. Now, when I ask for serious roles, they say nahi nahi aap toh comedy karte hain, because woh image comedy ki ban gayi hai.””


Ssumier adds that he is open to doing interesting TV roles, but he is not being approached for roles that he would prefer. “I did 'Tenali Rama' as it was an interesting character. The problem is that I don’t want to stand in line, and do those expressions and say dialogues like, ‘ haaw kheer gir gayi, chooha chala gaya.’ I would still do TV if it is an interesting role. I am not being approached for TV shows may be because people think ‘ ab aap TV kahan karenge’ or I might be charging a lot. These kind of perceptions are there. Sometimes, they want me to do a character that requires long-term commitment, which I cannot give at present. If it is an interesting and powerful cameo, I would love doing TV,” he adds."

Nimrat says that she has been visiting the gurdwara in Noida Sector 18 for almost 25 years, and even when she isn’t home on Gurpurab, she ensures to visit a gurdwara and serve langar. The actress says, “Gurpurab has always been special for me and my family. I’ve loved preparing langar and serving it. It’s kind of a back-breaking job as you have to stand the whole day, but it’s also one of the most rewarding feelings. In the evening, people who’ve been cooking serve you and then everyone eats together. It’s my most favourite memory of celebrating Gurpurab.”



People often spot her and recognise her while she is serving langar, and she says she does get selfie requests. Nimrat says, “People do spot me, and they want to take pictures. But the spirit and emotion of the day is such that everyone is so happy to be eating together and being served. People often come to me and say it is so wonderful to see me serving langar at the gurdwara.”

Nimrat says, “They say it inspires them, seeing someone who’s known coming and doing seva with them. I remember a young mother once came up to me and said, ‘It’s so nice that somebody like you is doing it ( seva). This is something kids should see and emulate as a quality.’” She adds, “ Seva is a big part of our faith. To serve and to be a part of the community is such a big part of Sikhi. People of all strata come together and their economic background or differences do not matter – they sit together and eat. I’m an Army girl and I’m from a Sikh family, and these are values of equality that have been inculcated in me since childhood.”

Nimrat, who came to Noida before Diwali, had plans to return to Mumbai after the festival, but has stayed back as her family asked her to. She says, “I have my grandmother and older members at home, and this is not a year to venture out. But, we all will pray at home, prepare food and see where we can serve it to the less privileged.”"
